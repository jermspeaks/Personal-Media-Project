Jacobs decides to dive in headfirst and attempt to obey the Bible as literally as possible for one full year. He vows to follow the Ten Commandments. To be fruitful and multiply. To love his neighbor. But also to obey the hundreds of less publicized rules: to avoid wearing clothes made of mixed fibers; to play a ten-string harp; to stone adulterers.<br><br>The resulting spiritual journey is at once funny and profound, reverent and irreverent, personal and universal and will make you see history's most influential book with new eyes.<br><br>Jacobs's quest transforms his life even more radically than the year spent reading the entire ""Encyclopedia Britannica"" for ""The Know-It-All."" His beard grows so unruly that he is regularly mistaken for a member of ZZ Top. He immerses himself in prayer, tends sheep in the Israeli desert, battles idolatry, and tells the absolute truth in all situations - much to his wife's chagrin.<br><br>Throughout the book, Jacobs also embeds himself in a cross-section of communities that take the Bible literally. He tours a Kentucky-based creationist museum and sings hymns with Pennsylvania Amish. He dances with Hasidic Jews in Brooklyn and does Scripture study with Jehovah's Witnesses. He discovers ancient biblical wisdom of startling relevance. And he wrestles with seemingly archaic rules that baffle the twenty-first-century brain.Jacobs's extraordinary undertaking yields unexpected epiphanies and challenges. A book that will charm readers both secular and religious, ""The Year of Living Biblically"" is part Cliff Notes to the Bible, part memoir, and part look into worlds unimaginable.

Now, in the wake of the global financial crisis, the principles of wikinomics have become more powerful than ever. <br><br> Many of the institutions that have served us well for decades or centuries seem stuck in the past and unable to move forward. And yet, in every corner of the globe, a powerful new model of economic and social innovation is sweeping across all sectors-one where people with drive, passion, and expertise take advantage of new Web-based tools to get more involved in making the world more prosperous, just, and sustainable. <br><br> Tapscott and Williams show that in over a dozen fields-from finance to health care, science to education, the media to the environment-we have reached a historic turning point: cling to the old industrial-era paradigms or use collaborative innovation to revolutionize not only the way we work, but how we live, learn, create, govern, and care for one another. You'll meet innovators such as: <br><br> * An Iraq veteran whose start-up car company is ""staffed"" by over 4,500 competing designers and supplied by microfactories around the world <br> * A microlending community where 570,000 individuals help fund new ventures-from Angola to Vietnam <br> * An online community for people with life-altering diseases that also serves as a large-scale research project <br> * An astronomer who is mapping the universe with the help of 250,000 citizen scientists <br><br> Tapscott and Williams once again use original research to provide vivid new examples of organizations that are successfully embracing the principles of wikinomics to change the world. <br><br> Visit <a href=""http://www.Macrowikinomics.com"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">www.Macrowikinomics.com</a>.","#<Hashie::Mash best_book_id=7857169 books_count=20 default_chaptering_book_id=nil default_description_language_code=nil desc_user_id=8606699 id=10995307 media_type=""book"" original_language_id=nil original_publication_day=1 original_publication_month=1 original_publication_year=2010 original_title=""Macrowikinomics: Rebooting Business and the World"" rating_dist=""5:86|4:117|3:99|2:48|1:9|total:359"" ratings_count=359 ratings_sum=1300 reviews_count=1021 text_reviews_count=45>",432,Hardcover,http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7857169-macrowikinomics,http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7857169-macrowikinomics,"[""Don Tapscott"", ""Anthony D.

At the same time, she can't shake the fact that she is the daughter of two back-to-the-land hippies who taught her to love nature and eat vegetables. Ambivalent about repeating her parents' disastrous mistakes, yet drawn to the idea of backyard self-sufficiency, Carpenter decided that it might be possible to have it both ways: a homegrown vegetable plot as well as museums, bars, concerts, and a twenty-four-hour convenience mart mere minutes away. Especially when she moved to a ramshackle house in inner city Oakland and discovered a weed-choked, garbage-strewn abandoned lot next door. She closed her eyes and pictured heirloom tomatoes, a beehive, and a chicken coop.<br><br> What started out as a few egg-laying chickens led to turkeys, geese, and ducks. Soon, some rabbits joined the fun, then two three-hundred-pound pigs. And no, these charming and eccentric animals weren't pets; she was a farmer, not a zookeeper. Novella was raising these animals for dinner. Novella Carpenter's corner of downtown Oakland is populated by unforgettable characters. Lana (<em>anal</em> spelled backward, she reminds us) runs a speakeasy across the street and refuses to hurt even a fly, let alone condone raising turkeys for Thanksgiving. Bobby, the homeless man who collects cars and car parts just outside the farm, is an invaluable neighborhood concierge. The turkeys, Harold and Maude, tend to escape on a daily basis to cavort with the prostitutes hanging around just off the highway nearby. Every day on this strange and beautiful farm, urban meets rural in the most surprising ways.<br><br> For anyone who has ever grown herbs on their windowsill, tomatoes on their fire escape, or obsessed over the offerings at the local farmers' market, Carpenter's story will capture your heart. And if you've ever considered leaving it all behind to become a farmer outside the city limits, or looked at the abandoned lot next door with a gleam in your eye, consider this both a cautionary tale and a full-throated call to action.<em> Farm City</em> is an unforgettably charming memoir, full of hilarious moments, fascinating farmers' tips, and a great deal of heart. It is also a moving meditation on urban life versus the natural world and what we have given up to live the way we do.","#<Hashie::Mash best_book_id=6164628 books_count=17 default_chaptering_book_id=nil default_description_language_code=nil desc_user_id=3960917 id=6343965 media_type=""book"" original_language_id=nil original_publication_day=nil original_publication_month=nil original_publication_year=2009 original_title=""Farm City: The Education of an Urban Farmer"" rating_dist=""5:2242|4:3069|3:1476|2:311|1:99|total:7197"" ratings_count=7197 ratings_sum=28635 reviews_count=16138 text_reviews_count=1184>",288,Hardcover,http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6164628-farm-city,http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6164628-farm-city,,

To one degree or another this simple question assails any creature faced with a wide choice of things to eat. Anthropologists call it the omnivore's dilemma. Choosing from among the countless potential foods nature offers, humans have had to learn what is safe, and what isn't—which mushrooms should be avoided, for example, and which berries we can enjoy. Today, as America confronts what can only be described as a national eating disorder, the omnivore's dilemma has returned with an atavistic vengeance. The cornucopia of the modern American supermarket and fast-food outlet has thrown us back on a bewildering landscape where we once again have to worry about which of those tasty-looking morsels might kill us. At the same time we're realizing that our food choices also have profound implications for the health of our environment. <em>The Omnivore's Dilemma</em> is bestselling author Michael Pollan's brilliant and eye-opening exploration of these little-known but vitally important dimensions of eating in America.<br><br> Pollan has divided <em>The Omnivore's Dilemma</em> into three parts, one for each of the food chains that sustain us: industrialized food, alternative or ""organic"" food, and food people obtain by dint of their own hunting, gathering, or gardening. Pollan follows each food chain literally from the ground up to the table, emphasizing our dynamic coevolutionary relationship with the species we depend on. He concludes each section by sitting down to a meal—at McDonald's, at home with his family sharing a dinner from Whole Foods, and in a revolutionary ""beyond organic"" farm in Virginia. For each meal he traces the provenance of everything consumed, revealing the hidden components we unwittingly ingest and explaining how our taste for particular foods reflects our environmental and biological inheritance.<br><br> We are indeed what we eat-and what we eat remakes the world. A society of voracious and increasingly confused omnivores, we are just beginning to recognize the profound consequences of the simplest everyday food choices, both for ourselves and for the natural world. <em>The Omnivore's Dilemma</em> is a long-overdue book and one that will become known for bringing a completely fresh perspective to a question as ordinary and yet momentous as What shall we have for dinner?<br><br>A few facts and figures from <em>The Omnivore's Dilemma</em>:<br>Of the 38 ingredients it takes to make a McNugget, there are at least 13 that are derived from corn. 45 different menu items at Mcdonald’s are made from corn. One in every three American children eats fast food every day. One in every five American meals today is eaten in the car. The food industry burns nearly a fifth of all the petroleum consumed in the United States—more than we burn with our cars and more than any other industry consumes. It takes ten calories of fossil fuel energy to deliver one calorie of food energy to an American plate. A single strawberry contains about five calories. To get that strawberry from a field in California to a plate on the east coast requires 435 calories of energy. Industrial fertilizer and industrial pesticides both owe their existence to the conversion of the World War II munitions industry to civilian uses—nerve gases became pesticides, and ammonium nitrate explosives became nitrogen fertilizers. ...","#<Hashie::Mash best_book_id=3109 books_count=54 default_chaptering_book_id=3109 default_description_language_code=nil desc_user_id=33867245 id=3287769 media_type=""book"" original_language_id=nil original_publication_day=nil original_publication_month=nil original_publication_year=2006 original_title=""The Omnivore's Dilemma"" rating_dist=""5:50128|4:49053|3:18737|2:3759|1:1240|total:122917"" ratings_count=122917 ratings_sum=511821 reviews_count=224488 text_reviews_count=11052>",451,Hardcover,http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3109.The_Omnivore_s_Dilemma,http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3109.The_Omnivore_s_Dilemma,,

Now, in <em>Blink</em>, he revolutionizes the way we understand the world within. <em>Blink</em> is a book about how we think without thinking, about choices that seem to be made in an instant--in the blink of an eye--that actually aren't as simple as they seem. Why are some people brilliant decision makers, while others are consistently inept? Why do some people follow their instincts and win, while others end up stumbling into error? How do our brains really work-in the office, in the classroom, in the kitchen, and in the bedroom? And why are the best decisions often those that are impossible to explain to others?<p>In <em>Blink</em> we meet the psychologist who has learned to predict whether a marriage will last, based on a few minutes of observing a couple; the tennis coach who knows when a player will double-fault before the racket even makes contact with the ball; the antiquities experts who recognize a fake at a glance. Here, too, are great failures of ""blink"": the election of Warren Harding; ""New Coke""; and the shooting of Amadou Diallo by police. <em>Blink</em> reveals that great decision makers aren't those who process the most information or spend the most time deliberating, but those who have perfected the art of ""thin-slicing""--filtering the very few factors that matter from an overwhelming number of variables.<br><br><em>Contents</em><br><br>Introduction: The statue that didn´t look right<br>1.

But as architect William McDonough and chemist Michael Braungart point out in this provocative, visionary book, such an approach only perpetuates the one-way, ""cradle to grave"" manufacturing model, dating to the Industrial Revolution, that creates such fantastic amounts of waste and pollution in the first place. Why not challenge the belief that human industry must damage the natural world? In fact, why not take nature itself as our model for making things? A tree produces thousands of blossoms in order to create another tree, yet we consider its abundance not wasteful but safe, beautiful, and highly effective.<br><br><strong>Waste equals food.</strong><br><br>Guided by this principle, McDonough and Braungart explain how products can be designed from the outset so that, after their useful lives, they will provide nourishment for something new. They can be conceived as ""biological nutrients"" that will easily reenter the water or soil without depositing synthetic materials and toxins. Or they can be ""technical nutrients"" that will continually circulate as pure and valuable materials within closed-loop industrial cycles, rather than being ""recycled"" -- really, downcycled -- into low-grade materials and uses. Drawing on their experience in (re)designing everything from carpeting to corporate campuses, McDonough and Braungart make an exciting and viable case for putting eco-effectiveness into practice, and show how anyone involved with making anything can begin to do as well. <br><br><strong>William McDonough</strong> is an architect and the founding principal of William McDonough + Partners, Architecture and Community Design, based in Charlottesville, Virginia. From 1994 to 1999 he served as dean of the school of architecture at the University of Virginia. In 1999 <em>Time</em> magazine recognized him as a ""Hero for the Planet,"" stating that ""his utopianism is grounded in a unified philosophy that -- in demonstrable and practical ways -- is changing the design of the world."" In 1996, he received the Presidential Award for Sustainable Development, the highest environmental honor given by the United States.<br><br><strong>Michael Braungart</strong> is a chemist and the founder of the Environmental Protection Encouragement Agency (EPEA) in Hamburg, Germany. Prior to starting EPEA, he was the director of the chemistry section for Greenpeace. Since 1984 he has been lecturing at universities, businesses, and institutions around the world on critical new concepts for ecological chemistry and materials flow management. Dr. Braungart is the recipient of numerous honors, awards, and fellowships from the Heinz Endowment, the W.

From the arrival of New England missionaries in 1820, their goal to Christianize the local heathen, to the coup d'état of the missionaries' sons in 1893, which overthrew the Hawaiian queen, the events leading up to American annexation feature a cast of beguiling, and often appealing or tragic, characters: whalers who fired cannons at the Bible-thumpers denying them their God-given right to whores, an incestuous princess pulled between her new god and her brother-husband, sugar barons, lepers, con men, Theodore Roosevelt, and the last Hawaiian queen, a songwriter whose sentimental ode ""Aloha 'Oe"" serenaded the first Hawaiian president of the United States during his 2009 inaugural parade.<br><br>With her trademark smart-alecky insights and reporting, Vowell lights out to discover the off, emblematic, and exceptional history of the fiftieth state, and in so doing finds America, warts and all.","#<Hashie::Mash best_book_id=8857310 books_count=9 default_chaptering_book_id=nil default_description_language_code=nil desc_user_id=1293927 id=13594625 media_type=""book"" original_language_id=nil original_publication_day=4 original_publication_month=2 original_publication_year=2011 original_title=nil rating_dist=""5:1422|4:3481|3:3174|2:823|1:179|total:9079"" ratings_count=9079 ratings_sum=32381 reviews_count=19184 text_reviews_count=1495>",238,Hardcover,http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8857310-unfamiliar-fishes,http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8857310-unfamiliar-fishes,,

Veteran technology reporter Steven Levy was granted unprecedented access to the company, and in this revelatory book he takes readers inside Google headquarters&amp;#8212;the Googleplex&amp;#8212;to show how Google works.<br><br> While they were still students at Stanford, Google cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin revolutionized Internet search. They followed this brilliant innovation with another, as two of Google&amp;#8217;s earliest employees found a way to do what no one else had: make billions of dollars from Internet advertising. With this cash cow, Google was able to expand dramatically and take on other transformative projects: more efficient data centers, open-source cell phones, free Internet video (YouTube), cloud computing, digitizing books, and much more.<br><br> The key to Google&amp;#8217;s success in all these businesses, Levy reveals, is its engineering mind-set and adoption of such Internet values as speed, openness, experimentation, and risk taking. After its unapologetically elitist approach to hiring, Google pampers its engineers&amp;#8212;free food and dry cleaning, on-site doctors and masseuses&amp;#8212;and gives them all the resources they need to succeed.

While paintings of Picasso and Jackson Pollock sell for a hundred million dollars or more, and lines from T. S. Eliot are quoted on the yearbook pages of alienated teenagers across the land, twentieth-century classical music still sends ripples of unease through audiences. At the same time, its influence can be felt everywhere. Atonal chords crop up in jazz. Avant-garde sounds populate the soundtracks of Hollywood thrillers. Minimalism has had a huge effect on rock, pop, and dance music from the Velvet Underground onward.<br><br><em>The Rest Is Noise</em> shows why twentieth-century composers felt compelled to create a famously bewildering variety of sounds, from the purest beauty to the purest noise. It tells of a remarkable array of maverick personalities who resisted the cult of the classical past, struggled against the indifference of a wide public, and defied the will of dictators. Whether they have charmed audiences with sweet sounds or battered them with dissonance, composers have always been exuberantly of the present, defying the stereotype of classical music as a dying art. The narrative goes from Vienna before the First World War to Paris in the twenties, from Hitler's Germany and Stalin's Russia to downtown New  York in the sixties and seventies. We follow the rise of mass culture and mass politics, of dramatic new technologies, of hot and cold wars, of experiments, revolutions, riots, and friendships forged and broken. The end result is not so much a history of twentieth-century music as a history of the twentieth century through its music.","#<Hashie::Mash best_book_id=392563 books_count=29 default_chaptering_book_id=nil default_description_language_code=nil desc_user_id=-30 id=2373496 media_type=""book"" original_language_id=nil original_publication_day=nil original_publication_month=nil original_publication_year=2007 original_title=""The Rest Is Noise: Listening to the Twentieth Century"" rating_dist=""5:3251|4:2533|3:1104|2:377|1:242|total:7507"" ratings_count=7507 ratings_sum=30695 reviews_count=20806 text_reviews_count=523>",640,Hardcover,http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/392563.The_Rest_Is_Noise,http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/392563.The_Rest_Is_Noise,,

A neuroanatomist by profession, she observed her own mind completely deteriorate to the point that she could not walk, talk, read, write, or recall any of her life, all within the space of four brief hours. As the damaged left side of her brain--the rational, grounded, detail- and time-oriented side--swung in and out of function, Taylor alternated between two distinct and opposite realities: the euphoric nirvana of the intuitive and kinesthetic right brain, in which she felt a sense of complete well-being and peace; and the logical, sequential left brain, which recognized Jill was having a stroke, and enabled her to seek help before she was lost completely.<br><br> In <em>My Stroke of Insight</em>, Taylor shares her unique perspective on the brain and its capacity for recovery, and the sense of omniscient understanding she gained from this unusual and inspiring voyage out of the abyss of a wounded brain. It would take eight years for Taylor to heal completely. Because of her knowledge of how the brain works, her respect for the cells composing her human form, and most of all an amazing mother, Taylor completely repaired her mind and recalibrated her understanding of the world according to the insights gained from her right brain that morning of December 10th.  <br><br> Today Taylor is convinced that the stroke was the best thing that could have happened to her. It has taught her that the feeling of nirvana is never more than a mere thought away. By <em>stepping to the right of our left brains</em>, we can all uncover the feelings of well-being and peace that are so often sidelined by our own brain chatter. A fascinating journey into the mechanics of the human mind, <em>My Stroke of Insight</em> is both a valuable recovery guide for anyone touched by a brain injury, and an emotionally stirring testimony that deep internal peace truly is accessible to anyone, at any time.","#<Hashie::Mash best_book_id=142292 books_count=59 default_chaptering_book_id=nil default_description_language_code=nil desc_user_id=171430 id=137242 media_type=""book"" original_language_id=nil original_publication_day=nil original_publication_month=nil original_publication_year=2006 original_title=""My Stroke of Insight"" rating_dist=""5:4136|4:5330|3:3706|2:1135|1:205|total:14512"" ratings_count=14512 ratings_sum=55593 reviews_count=27021 text_reviews_count=2501>","","",http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/142292.My_Stroke_of_Insight,http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/142292.My_Stroke_of_Insight,,

Having defined the technium, Kelly addresses its discontents, as expressed by the Unabomber (although Kelly admits to trepidation in taking seriously the antitechnology screeds of a murderer) and then as lived by the allegedly technophobic Amish. From his observations and discussions with some Amish people, Kelly extracts some precepts of their attitudes toward gadgets, suggesting folk in the secular world can benefit from the Amish approach of treating tools as servants of self and society rather than as out-of-control masters.

With the right mindset, we can motivate our kids and help them to raise their grades, as well as reach our own goals—personal and professional.

They are the ones who prefer listening to speaking, reading to partying; who innovate and create but dislike self-promotion; who favor working on their own over brainstorming in teams. Although they are often labeled ""quiet,"" it is to introverts that we owe many of the great contributions to society--from van Gogh’s sunflowers to the invention of the personal computer.<br><br>Passionately argued, impressively researched, and filled with indelible stories of real people, <em>Quiet </em>shows how dramatically we undervalue introverts, and how much we lose in doing so. Taking the reader on a journey from Dale Carnegie’s birthplace to Harvard Business School, from a Tony Robbins seminar to an evangelical megachurch, Susan Cain charts the rise of the Extrovert Ideal in the twentieth century and explores its far-reaching effects. She talks to Asian-American students who feel alienated from the brash, backslapping atmosphere of American schools. She questions the dominant values of American business culture, where forced collaboration can stand in the way of innovation, and where the leadership potential of introverts is often overlooked.

An ambitious urban entrepreneur who rose up the social ladder, from leather-aproned shopkeeper to dining with kings, he seems made of flesh rather than of marble. In bestselling author Walter Isaacson's vivid and witty full-scale biography, we discover why Franklin seems to turn to us from history's stage with eyes that twinkle from behind his new-fangled spectacles. By bringing Franklin to life, Isaacson shows how he helped to define both his own time and ours. <p> He was, during his 84-year life, America's best scientist, inventor, diplomat, writer, and business strategist, and he was also one of its most practical -- though not most profound -- political thinkers. He proved by flying a kite that lightning was electricity, and he invented a rod to tame it. He sought practical ways to make stoves less smoky and commonwealths less corrupt. He organized neighborhood constabularies and international alliances, local lending libraries and national legislatures. He combined two types of lenses to create bifocals and two concepts of representation to foster the nation's federal compromise. He was the only man who shaped all the founding documents of America: the Albany Plan of Union, the Declaration of Independence, the treaty of alliance with France, the peace treaty with England, and the Constitution. And he helped invent America's unique style of homespun humor, democratic values, and philosophical pragmatism. </p><p> But the most interesting thing that Franklin invented, and continually reinvented, was himself. America's first great publicist, he was, in his life and in his writings, consciously trying to create a new American archetype. In the process, he carefully crafted his own persona, portrayed it in public, and polished it for posterity. </p><p> Through it all, he trusted the hearts and minds of his fellow ""leather-aprons"" more than he did those of any inbred elite. He saw middle-class values as a source of social strength, not as something to be derided. His guiding principle was a ""dislike of everything that tended to debase the spirit of the common people."" Few of his fellow founders felt this comfort with democracy so fully, and none so intuitively. </p><p> In this colorful and intimate narrative, Isaacson provides the full sweep of Franklin's amazing life, from his days as a runaway printer to his triumphs as a statesman, scientist, and Founding Father. He chronicles Franklin's tumultuous relationship with his illegitimate son and grandson, his practical marriage, and his flirtations with the ladies of Paris. He also shows how Franklin helped to create the American character and why he has a particular resonance in the twenty-first century.</p>","#<Hashie::Mash best_book_id=10883 books_count=23 default_chaptering_book_id=nil default_description_language_code=nil desc_user_id=-30 id=750514 media_type=""book"" original_language_id=nil original_publication_day=nil original_publication_month=nil original_publication_year=2003 original_title=""Benjamin Franklin: An American Life"" rating_dist=""5:15388|4:16622|3:8758|2:2121|1:1793|total:44682"" ratings_count=44682 ratings_sum=175737 reviews_count=124498 text_reviews_count=1035>",586,Paperback,http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10883.Benjamin_Franklin,http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10883.Benjamin_Franklin,,

The twentieth century—a time of unprecedented progress—has produced a tremendous strain on the very elements that comprise life itself: This raises the key question of the twenty-first century: How much longer can this go on? With wit and erudition, Ronald Wright lays out a-convincing case that history has always provided an answer, whether we care to notice or not. From Neanderthal man to the Sumerians to the Roman Empire, A Short History of Progress dissects the cyclical nature of humanity's development and demise, the 10,000-year old experiment that we've unleashed but have yet to control. It is Wright's contention that only by understanding and ultimately breaking from the patterns of progress and disaster that humanity has repeated around the world since the Stone Age can we avoid the onset of a new Dark Age. Wright illustrates how various cultures throughout history have literally manufactured their own end by producing an overabundance of innovation and stripping bare the very elements that allowed them to initially advance. Wright's book is brilliant; a fascinating rumination on the hubris at the heart of human development and the pitfalls we still may have time to avoid.","#<Hashie::Mash best_book_id=331227 books_count=23 default_chaptering_book_id=nil default_description_language_code=nil desc_user_id=3615356 id=321797 media_type=""book"" original_language_id=nil original_publication_day=nil original_publication_month=nil original_publication_year=2004 original_title=""A Short History of Progress"" rating_dist=""5:876|4:961|3:412|2:80|1:24|total:2353"" ratings_count=2353 ratings_sum=9644 reviews_count=5559 text_reviews_count=217>",224,Paperback,http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/331227.A_Short_History_of_Progress,http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/331227.A_Short_History_of_Progress,,

He had been named one of the best new chefs in America by <em>Food &amp; Wine</em> in 2002, received the James Beard Foundation Rising Star Chef of the Year Award in 2003, and in 2005 he and Nick Kokonas opened the conceptually radical restaurant Alinea, which was named Best Restaurant in America by <em>Gourmet</em> magazine. Then, positioned firmly in the world's culinary spotlight, Achatz was diagnosed with stage IV squamous cell carcinoma-tongue cancer. <br><br> The prognosis was grim, and doctors agreed the only course of action was to remove the cancerous tissue, which included his entire tongue. Desperate to preserve his quality of life, Grant undertook an alternative treatment of aggressive chemotherapy and radiation. But the choice came at a cost. Skin peeled from the inside of Grant's mouth and throat, he rapidly lost weight, and most alarmingly, he lost his sense of taste. Tapping into the discipline, passion, and focus of being a chef, Grant rarely missed a day of work. He trained his chefs to mimic his palate and learned how to cook with his other senses. As Kokonas was able to attest: The food was never better. Five months later, Grant was declared cancer-free, and just a few months following, he received the James Beard Foundation Outstanding Chef in America Award.  <br><br><em>Life, on the Line</em> tells the story of a culinary trailblazer's love affair with cooking, but it is also a book about survival, about nurturing creativity, and about profound friendship. Already much- anticipated by followers of progressive cuisine, Grant and Nick's gripping narrative is filled with stories from the world's most renowned kitchens-The French Laundry, Charlie Trotter's, el Bulli- and sure to expand the audience that made <em>Alinea</em> the number-one selling restaurant cookbook in America last year.","#<Hashie::Mash best_book_id=8667490 books_count=11 default_chaptering_book_id=nil default_description_language_code=nil desc_user_id=603238 id=13539257 media_type=""book"" original_language_id=nil original_publication_day=26 original_publication_month=1 original_publication_year=2011 original_title=""Life, on the Line: A Chef's Story of Chasing Greatness, Facing Death, and Redefining the Way We Eat"" rating_dist=""5:1138|4:1291|3:657|2:125|1:36|total:3247"" ratings_count=3247 ratings_sum=13111 reviews_count=7236 text_reviews_count=425>",400,Hardcover,http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8667490-life-on-the-line,http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8667490-life-on-the-line,"[""Grant Achatz"", ""Nick Kokonas""]","

We visit laboratories where neuroscientists explore how habits work and where, exactly, they reside in our brains. We discover how the right habits were crucial to the success of Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, and civil-rights hero Martin Luther King, Jr. We go inside Procter &amp; Gamble, Target superstores, Rick Warren’s Saddleback Church, NFL locker rooms, and the nation’s largest hospitals and see how implementing so-called keystone habits can earn billions and mean the difference between failure and success, life and death.<br> <br>At its core, <em>The Power of Habit</em> contains an exhilarating argument: The key to exercising regularly, losing weight, raising exceptional children, becoming more productive, building revolutionary companies and social movements, and achieving success is understanding how habits work. <br> <br>Habits aren’t destiny. As Charles Duhigg shows, by harnessing this new science, we can transform our businesses, our communities, and our lives.","#<Hashie::Mash best_book_id=12609433 books_count=65 default_chaptering_book_id=nil default_description_language_code=nil desc_user_id=13984570 id=17624817 media_type=""book"" original_language_id=nil original_publication_day=nil original_publication_month=nil original_publication_year=2011 original_title=""The Power of Habit"" rating_dist=""5:30501|4:36054|3:19782|2:4251|1:1890|total:92478"" ratings_count=92478 ratings_sum=366459 reviews_count=245808 text_reviews_count=5993>",286,Hardcover,http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12609433-the-power-of-habit,http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12609433-the-power-of-habit,,

Joshua Foer used to be one of those people. But after a year of memory training, he found himself in the finals of the U.S. Memory Championship. Even more important, Foer found a vital truth we too often forget: In every way that matters, we are the sum of our memories. <br><br><em>Moonwalking with Einstein</em> draws on cutting-edge research, a surprising cultural history of memory, and venerable tricks of the mentalist's trade to transform our understanding of human remembering. Under the tutelage of top ""mental athletes,"" he learns ancient techniques once employed by Cicero to memorize his speeches and by Medieval scholars to memorize entire books. Using methods that have been largely forgotten, Foer discovers that we can all dramatically improve our memories. <br><br> Immersing himself obsessively in a quirky subculture of competitive memorizers, Foer learns to apply techniques that call on imagination as much as determination--showing that memorization can be anything but rote. From the PAO system, which converts numbers into lurid images, to the memory palace, in which memories are stored in the rooms of imaginary structures, Foer's experience shows that the World Memory Championships are less a test of memory than of perseverance and creativity. <br><br> Foer takes his inquiry well beyond the arena of mental athletes-across the country and deep into his own mind. In San Diego, he meets an affable old man with one of the most severe case of amnesia on record, where he learns that memory is at once more elusive and more reliable than we might think. In Salt Lake City, he swaps secrets with a savant who claims to have memorized more than nine thousand books. At a high school in the South Bronx, he finds a history teacher using twenty- five-hundred-year-old memory techniques to give his students an edge in the state Regents exam. <br><br> At a time when electronic devices have all but rendered our individual memories obsolete, Foer's bid to resurrect the forgotten art of remembering becomes an urgent quest. <em>Moonwalking with Einstein</em> brings Joshua Foer to the apex of the U.S. Memory Championship and readers to a profound appreciation of a gift we all possess but that too often slips our minds.","#<Hashie::Mash best_book_id=6346975 books_count=52 default_chaptering_book_id=nil default_description_language_code=nil desc_user_id=16719249 id=6533383 media_type=""book"" original_language_id=nil original_publication_day=1 original_publication_month=1 original_publication_year=2011 original_title=""Moonwalking with Einstein: The Art and Science of Remembering Everything"" rating_dist=""5:10407|4:15839|3:10006|2:2412|1:949|total:39613"" ratings_count=39613 ratings_sum=151182 reviews_count=108219 text_reviews_count=3264>",307,Hardcover,http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6346975-moonwalking-with-einstein,http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6346975-moonwalking-with-einstein,,

Two great leaders—Lord Eddard Stark and Robert Baratheon—who held sway over an age of enforced peace are dead...victims of royal treachery. Now, from the ancient citadel of Dragonstone to the forbidding shores of Winterfell, chaos reigns, as pretenders to the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms prepare to stake their claims through tempest, turmoil, and war. <br><br>As a prophecy of doom cuts across the sky—a comet the color of blood and flame—six factions struggle for control of a divided land.

Through uplifting stories, parables, and personal anecdotes, the Zanders invite us to become passionate communicators, leaders, and performers whose lives radiate possibility into the world","#<Hashie::Mash best_book_id=85697 books_count=19 default_chaptering_book_id=nil default_description_language_code=nil desc_user_id=-9 id=82694 media_type=""book"" original_language_id=nil original_publication_day=nil original_publication_month=nil original_publication_year=2000 original_title=""The Art of Possibility: Transforming Professional and Personal Life"" rating_dist=""5:1346|4:1118|3:622|2:176|1:47|total:3309"" ratings_count=3309 ratings_sum=13467 reviews_count=7812 text_reviews_count=453>",210,Paperback,http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/85697.The_Art_of_Possibility,http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/85697.The_Art_of_Possibility,"[""Rosamund Stone Zander"", ""Benjamin Zander""]","

But instead he woke up one day to find himself fired from his radio job, surrounded by feral cats, and emotionally and financially annihilated by a divorce from a woman he thought he loved. He tried to heal his broken heart through whatever means he could find—minor-league hoarding, Viagra addiction, accidental racial profiling, cat fancying, flying airplanes with his mind—but nothing seemed to work. It was only when he was stripped down to nothing that he found his way back.<br>  <br><em>Attempting Normal</em> is Marc Maron’s journey through the wilderness of his own mind, a collection of explosively, painfully, addictively funny stories that add up to a moving tale of hope and hopelessness, of failing, flailing, and finding a way. From standup to television to his outrageously popular podcast, <em>WTF with Marc Maron,</em> Marc has always been a genuine original, a disarmingly honest, intensely smart, brutally open comic who finds wisdom in the strangest places. This is his story of the winding, potholed road from madness and obsession and failure to something like normal, the thrillingly comic journey of a sympathetic f***up who’s trying really hard to do better without making a bigger mess.

Here, he discovers the enduring power of the four classical elements—fire, water, air, and earth—to transform the stuff of nature into delicious things to eat and drink. Apprenticing himself to a succession of culinary masters, Pollan learns how to grill with fire, cook with liquid, bake bread, and ferment everything from cheese to beer. In the course of his journey, he discovers that the cook occupies a special place in the world, standing squarely between nature and culture. Both realms are transformed by cooking, and so, in the process, is the cook.<br><br> Each section of <em>Cooked</em> tracks Pollan’s effort to master a single classic recipe using one of the four elements. A North Carolina barbecue pit master tutors him in the primal magic of fire; a Chez Panisse–trained cook schools him in the art of braising; a celebrated baker teaches him how air transforms grain and water into a fragrant loaf of bread; and finally, several mad-genius “fermentos” (a tribe that includes brewers, cheese makers, and all kinds of picklers) reveal how fungi and bacteria can perform the most amazing alchemies of all. The reader learns alongside Pollan, but the lessons move beyond the practical to become an investigation of how cooking involves us in a web of social and ecological relationships: with plants and animals, the soil, farmers, our history and culture, and, of course, the people our cooking nourishes and delights. Cooking, above all, connects us.<br><br> The effects of not cooking are similarly far reaching. Relying upon corporations to process our food means we consume huge quantities of fat, sugar, and salt; disrupt an essential link to the natural world; and weaken our relationships with family and friends. In fact, <em>Cooked</em> argues, taking back control of cooking may be the single most important step anyone can take to help make the American food system healthier and more sustainable. Reclaiming cooking as an act of enjoyment and self-reliance, learning to perform the magic of these everyday transformations, opens the door to a more nourishing life.<br><br><br>","#<Hashie::Mash best_book_id=15811496 books_count=26 default_chaptering_book_id=nil default_description_language_code=nil desc_user_id=-44 id=21536760 media_type=""book"" original_language_id=nil original_publication_day=1 original_publication_month=1 original_publication_year=2013 original_title=""Cooked: A Natural History of Transformation "" rating_dist=""5:4301|4:5096|3:2682|2:711|1:382|total:13172"" ratings_count=13172 ratings_sum=51739 reviews_count=37403 text_reviews_count=1420>",468,Hardcover,http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15811496-cooked,http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15811496-cooked,,

Its aim is invincibility, victory without battle, and unassailable strength through understanding the physics, politics, and psychology of conflict.<br><br>(Original publish date was circa 500 BCE.)<br><br>For an outstanding kindle edition, please refer to The Art of War by Sun Tzu - Classic Collector's Edition (Shawn Conners, Barton Williams, Lionel Giles, Sian Kim)","#<Hashie::Mash best_book_id=10534 books_count=1197 default_chaptering_book_id=nil default_description_language_code=nil desc_user_id=13595172 id=3200649 media_type=""book"" original_language_id=nil original_publication_day=nil original_publication_month=nil original_publication_year=-512 original_title=""孫子兵法 - Sūnzǐ Bīngfǎ "" rating_dist=""5:46592|4:47657|3:33614|2:8235|1:1916|total:138014"" ratings_count=138014 ratings_sum=542816 reviews_count=283748 text_reviews_count=4202>",273,Paperback,http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10534.The_Art_of_War,http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10534.The_Art_of_War,"[""Sun Tzu"", ""Thomas Cleary""]","

Spending time with organic farmers, venture capitalists, screenwriters, freelance computer programmers, and others who admitted to deriving great satisfaction from their work, Newport uncovers the strategies they used and the pitfalls they avoided in developing their compelling careers. <br> Matching your job to a preexisting passion does not matter, he reveals. Passion comes after you put in the hard work to become excellent at something valuable, not before. <br> In other words, what you do for a living is much less important than how you do it.<br> With a title taken from the comedian Steve Martin, who once said his advice for aspiring entertainers was to ""be so good they can't ignore you,"" Cal Newport's clearly written manifesto is mandatory reading for anyone fretting about what to do with their life, or frustrated by their current job situation and eager to find a fresh new way to take control of their livelihood.

Committed to sharing what the scientific community already knew about self-control, McGonigal created a course called ""The Science of Willpower"" for Stanford University's Continuing Studies Program. The course was an instant hit and spawned the hugely successful <em>Psychology Today</em> blog with the same name.<br><br>Informed by the latest research and combining cutting-edge insights from psychology, economics, neuroscience, and medicine, McGonigal's book explains exactly what willpower is, how it works, and why it matters. Readers will learn:<br><br><br>Willpower is a mind-body response, not a virtue. It is a biological function that can be improved through mindfulness, exercise, nutrition, and sleep.

Dieting is a popular hobby in the twenty-first century, and the result is typically a slow but steady weight gain over the years. Oops. Diets fail because they rely on willpower and restriction for achieving health goals, and ignore the reasons these tactics always backfire. Becoming a foodist helps you give up dieting forever and get on the real path to healthy, lasting weight control.<br><br><em>Foodist</em> is an approach that actually celebrates food while taking you through the nutrition and psychology involved in eating well to help you move beyond the daily obstacles and bad habits that keep the tasteless, empty, and unsatisfying food-like products on your plate. Losing weight no longer has to be about sacrifice, deprivation, and willpower, and food will turn from something you fight into something you can actually love again. As Darya writes, ""You don't need a diet. You need an upgrade.""<br><br>Smart, accessible, and engaging, <em>Foodist</em> will help you tailor your eating habits to match your lifestyle and your food preferences, making sure the path you choose works for you in the short- and long-term.

The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; . . . who at best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly.” —Theodore Roosevelt<br><br>Every day we experience the uncertainty, risks, and emotional exposure that define what it means to be vulnerable, or to dare greatly. Whether the arena is a new relationship, an important meeting, our creative process, or a difficult family conversation, we must find the courage to walk into vulnerability and engage with our whole hearts.<br><br>In <em>Daring Greatly</em>, Dr. Brown challenges everything we think we know about vulnerability. Based on twelve years of research, she argues that vulnerability is not weakness, but rather our clearest path to courage, engagement, and meaningful connection. The book that Dr. Brown’s many fans have been waiting for, <em>Daring Greatly</em> will spark a new spirit of truth—and trust—in our organizations, families, schools, and communities.","#<Hashie::Mash best_book_id=13588356 books_count=40 default_chaptering_book_id=nil default_description_language_code=nil desc_user_id=7048635 id=19175758 media_type=""book"" original_language_id=nil original_publication_day=nil original_publication_month=nil original_publication_year=2012 original_title=""Daring Greatly: How the Courage to Be Vulnerable Transforms the Way We Live, Love, Parent, and Lead"" rating_dist=""5:12119|4:7794|3:3323|2:859|1:417|total:24512"" ratings_count=24512 ratings_sum=103875 reviews_count=65758 text_reviews_count=2619>",287,Hardcover,http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13588356-daring-greatly,http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13588356-daring-greatly,,

We ingest 8,500 milligrams of salt a day, double the recommended amount, and almost none of that comes from the shakers on our table. It comes from processed food. It’s no wonder, then, that one in three adults, and one in five kids, is clinically obese. It’s no wonder that 26 million Americans have diabetes, the processed food industry in the U.S. accounts for $1 trillion a year in sales, and the total economic cost of this health crisis is approaching $300 billion a year.<br><br>In Salt Sugar Fat, Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative reporter Michael Moss shows how we got here. Featuring examples from some of the most recognizable (and profitable) companies and brands of the last half century - including Kraft, Coca-Cola, Lunchables, Kellogg, Nestlé, Oreos, Cargill, Capri Sun, and many more - Moss’s explosive, empowering narrative is grounded in meticulous, often eye-opening research.<br><br>Moss takes us inside the labs where food scientists use cutting-edge technology to calculate the ""bliss point"" of sugary beverages or enhance the ""mouthfeel"" of fat by manipulating its chemical structure. He unearths marketing campaigns designed - in a technique adapted from tobacco companies - to redirect concerns about the health risks of their products: Dial back on one ingredient, pump up the other two, and tout the new line as ""fat-free"" or ""low-salt"". He talks to concerned executives who confess that they could never produce truly healthy alternatives to their products even if serious regulation became a reality. Simply put: The industry itself would cease to exist without salt, sugar, and fat. Just as millions of ""heavy users"" - as the companies refer to their most ardent customers - are addicted to this seductive trio, so too are the companies that peddle them. You will never look at a nutrition label the same way again.","#<Hashie::Mash best_book_id=15797397 books_count=29 default_chaptering_book_id=nil default_description_language_code=nil desc_user_id=1237196 id=21520265 media_type=""book"" original_language_id=nil original_publication_day=nil original_publication_month=nil original_publication_year=2013 original_title=""Salt Sugar Fat: How the Food Giants Hooked Us "" rating_dist=""5:4953|4:6502|3:3123|2:718|1:358|total:15654"" ratings_count=15654 ratings_sum=61936 reviews_count=43913 text_reviews_count=2137>",446,Hardcover,http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15797397-salt-sugar-fat,http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15797397-salt-sugar-fat,,

The drama of its birth, played out on canvas and against the backdrop of the Franco-Prussian War and the Commune, would at times resemble a battlefield; and as Ross King reveals, it would reorder both history and culture, and resonate around the world.","#<Hashie::Mash best_book_id=56912 books_count=24 default_chaptering_book_id=nil default_description_language_code=nil desc_user_id=9569820 id=1283019 media_type=""book"" original_language_id=nil original_publication_day=10 original_publication_month=1 original_publication_year=2006 original_title=""The Judgment of Paris: The Revolutionary Decade that Gave the World Impressionism"" rating_dist=""5:2932|4:2402|3:1943|2:716|1:437|total:8430"" ratings_count=8430 ratings_sum=31966 reviews_count=17515 text_reviews_count=221>",464,Paperback,http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56912.The_Judgment_of_Paris,http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56912.The_Judgment_of_Paris,,

But many of those failures are preventable.  The Lean Startup is a new approach being adopted across the globe, changing the way companies are built and new products are launched. <br></strong><br>Eric Ries defines a startup as <strong>an organization dedicated to creating something new under conditions of extreme uncertainty</strong>. This is just as true for one person in a garage or a group of seasoned professionals in a Fortune 500 boardroom. What they have in common is a mission to penetrate that fog of uncertainty to discover a successful path to a sustainable business. <br><br>The Lean Startup approach fosters companies that are both more capital efficient and that leverage human creativity more effectively.  Inspired by lessons from lean manufacturing, it relies on “validated learning,” rapid scientific experimentation, as well as a number of counter-intuitive practices that shorten product development cycles, measure actual progress without resorting to vanity metrics, and learn what customers really want. It enables a company to shift directions with agility, altering plans inch by inch, minute by minute. <br><br>Rather than wasting time creating elaborate business plans, <em>The Lean Startup</em> offers entrepreneurs - in companies of all sizes - a way to test their vision continuously, to adapt and adjust before it’s too late.

In <em>A Guide to the Good Life</em>, William B. Irvine plumbs the wisdom of Stoic philosophy, one of the most popular and successful schools of thought in ancient Rome, and shows how its insight and advice are still remarkably applicable to modern lives.<br>       In <em>A Guide to the Good Life</em>, Irvine offers a refreshing presentation of Stoicism, showing how this ancient philosophy can still direct us toward a better life. Using the psychological insights and the practical techniques of the Stoics, Irvine offers a roadmap for anyone seeking to avoid the feelings of chronic dissatisfaction that plague so many of us. Irvine looks at various Stoic techniques for attaining tranquility and shows how to put these techniques to work in our own life. As he does so, he describes his own experiences practicing Stoicism and offers valuable first-hand advice for anyone wishing to live better by following in the footsteps of these ancient philosophers. Readers learn how to minimize worry, how to let go of the past and focus our efforts on the things we can control, and how to deal with insults, grief, old age, and the distracting temptations of fame and fortune. We learn from Marcus Aurelius the importance of prizing only things of true value, and from Epictetus we learn how to be more content with what we have.<br>        Finally, <em>A Guide to the Good Life</em> shows readers how to become thoughtful observers of their own life.  If we watch ourselves as we go about our daily business and later reflect on what we saw, we can better identify the sources of distress and eventually avoid that pain in our life. By doing this, the Stoics thought, we can hope to attain a truly joyful life.","#<Hashie::Mash best_book_id=5617966 books_count=10 default_chaptering_book_id=nil default_description_language_code=nil desc_user_id=14767906 id=5789357 media_type=""book"" original_language_id=nil original_publication_day=1 original_publication_month=1 original_publication_year=nil original_title=""A Guide to the Good Life: The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy"" rating_dist=""5:1264|4:1231|3:511|2:101|1:22|total:3129"" ratings_count=3129 ratings_sum=13001 reviews_count=7651 text_reviews_count=275>",326,Hardcover,http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5617966-a-guide-to-the-good-life,http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5617966-a-guide-to-the-good-life,,

Ray neglected his work, spending hours poring over ancient French winemaking texts, learning the techniques and the language, and daydreaming about vineyards. After Ray experienced his first taste of wine from Burgundy, he could wait no longer. He quit his job and went to France to start a winery—with little money, a limited command of French, and virtually no winemaking experience. <br><br>Fueled by determination and <em>joie de vivre</em>, he immersed himself in the extraordinary history of Burgundy’s vineyards and began honing his skills.

Knopf (NY),en-GB,"Over 200 million years ago, geological forces split apart the continents. They developed different suites of flora &amp; fauna. When Columbus came to the Americas, he ended that separation. Driven by the goal of establishing trade with China, he accidentally set off an ecological convulsion as European vessels carried thousands of species to new environs.<br><br>The Columbian Exchange, as researchers call it, is why there are tomatoes in Italy, oranges in Florida, chocolates in Switzerland &amp; chili peppers in Thailand. More important, creatures colonists knew nothing about hitched along. Earthworms, mosquitoes &amp; cockroaches; honeybees, dandelions &amp; African grasses; bacteria, fungi &amp; viruses; rats of every description—all rushed like eager tourists into lands that had never seen their like, changing lives &amp; landscapes.<br><br>Eight decades later, a Spaniard named Legazpi succeeded where Columbus had failed. He sailed west to establish continual trade with China, then the richest, most powerful country. In Manila, a city Legazpi founded, American silver, mined by African &amp; Indian slaves, was sold to Asians in return for silk for Europeans. It was the 1st time that goods &amp; people from every part of the globe were connected in a single worldwide exchange. Much as Columbus created a new world biologically, Legazpi &amp; Spain created a new world economically.<br><br>The Columbian Exchange underlies much of subsequent history. Presenting the latest research by ecologists, anthropologists, archaeologists &amp; historians, Mann shows how the creation of this worldwide network of ecological &amp; economic exchange fostered the rise of Europe, devastated China, convulsed Africa &amp; for two centuries made Mexico City--where Asia, Europe &amp; the new frontier of the Americas interacted--the center of the world. In such encounters, he uncovers the germ of today’s political disputes, from immigration to trade policy to culture wars.","#<Hashie::Mash best_book_id=9862761 books_count=28 default_chaptering_book_id=nil default_description_language_code=nil desc_user_id=1468895 id=14754158 media_type=""book"" original_language_id=nil original_publication_day=nil original_publication_month=nil original_publication_year=2011 original_title=""1493: Uncovering the New World Columbus Created"" rating_dist=""5:3239|4:3419|3:1630|2:399|1:171|total:8858"" ratings_count=8858 ratings_sum=35730 reviews_count=24981 text_reviews_count=914>",557,Hardcover,http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9862761-1493,http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9862761-1493,,

For those who’ve despaired of ever learning a foreign language, here, finally, is a book that will make the words stick.<strong> </strong>At thirty years old, Gabriel Wyner speaks <em>six </em>languages fluently.  He didn’t learn them in school -- who does? -- rather, he learned them in the past few years, working on his own and practicing on the subway, using simple techniques and free online resources. In <em>Fluent Forever</em> Wyner reveals what he’s discovered.  <br><strong> </strong><br>The greatest challenge to learning a foreign language is the challenge of memory; there are just too many words and too many rules. For every new word we learn, we seem to forget two old ones, and as a result, fluency can seem out of reach. <em>Fluent Forever</em> tackles this challenge head-on.

You'll retrain your tongue to produce those sounds accurately, using tricks from opera singers and actors. Next, you'll begin to tackle words, and connect sounds and spellings to imagery, rather than translations, which will enable you to <em>think</em> in a foreign language<em>.  </em>And with the help of sophisticated spaced-repetition techniques, you'll be able to memorize hundreds of words a month in <em>minutes</em> every day. Soon, you'll gain the ability to learn grammar and more difficult abstract words--<em>without </em>the tedious drills and exercises of language classes and grammar books. <br> <br>This is brain hacking at its most exciting, taking what we know about neuroscience and linguistics and using it to create the most efficient and enjoyable way to learn a foreign language in the spare minutes of your day.","#<Hashie::Mash best_book_id=10144223 books_count=1 default_chaptering_book_id=nil default_description_language_code=nil desc_user_id=4766843 id=15042446 media_type=""book"" original_language_id=nil original_publication_day=5 original_publication_month=1 original_publication_year=2011 original_title=nil rating_dist=""5:2|4:0|3:0|2:0|1:2|total:4"" ratings_count=4 ratings_sum=12 reviews_count=10 text_reviews_count=3>",186,Paperback,http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10144223-the-spiritual-power-of-nonviolence,http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10144223-the-spiritual-power-of-nonviolence,,

Between 1942 and 1945, Frankl labored in four different camps, including Auschwitz, while his parents, brother, and pregnant wife perished. Based on his own experience and the experiences of others he treated later in his practice, Frankl argues that we cannot avoid suffering, but we can choose how to cope with it, find meaning in it, and move forward with renewed purpose. Frankl's theory--known as logotherapy, from the Greek word logos (""meaning"")--holds that our primary drive in life is not pleasure, as Freud maintained, but the discovery and pursuit of what we personally find meaningful.<br><br>At the time of Frankl's death in 1997, <em>Man's Search for Meaning</em> had sold more than 10 million copies in twenty-four languages.

Habits are the invisible architecture of everyday life. It takes work to make a habit, but once that habit is set, we can harness the energy of habits to build happier, stronger, more productive lives.<br>  <br> So if habits are a key to change, then what we really need to know is: <em>How do we change our habits</em>?<br>  <br><em>Better than Before</em> answers that question. It presents a practical, concrete framework to allow readers to understand their habits—and to change them for good. Infused with Rubin’s compelling voice, rigorous research, and easy humor, and packed with vivid stories of lives transformed, <em>Better than Before</em> explains the (sometimes counter-intuitive) core principles of habit formation. <br>  <br> Along the way, Rubin uses herself as guinea pig, tests her theories on family and friends, and answers readers’ most pressing questions—oddly, questions that other writers and researchers tend to ignore: <br><br>• Why do I find it tough to create a habit for something I <em>love</em> to do? <br>• Sometimes I can change a habit overnight, and sometimes I can’t change a habit, no matter how hard I try. Why? <br>• How quickly can I change a habit? <br>• What can I do to make sure I stick to a new habit? <br>• How can I help someone else change a habit? <br>• Why can I keep habits that benefit others, but can’t make habits that are just for me? <br><br> Whether readers want to get more sleep, stop checking their devices, maintain a healthy weight, or finish an important project, habits make change possible.

With <em>Assassination Vacation,</em> she takes us on a road trip like no other—a journey to the pit stops of American political murder and through the myriad ways they have been used for fun and profit, for political and cultural advantage.<br><br>From Buffalo to Alaska, Washington to the Dry Tortugas, Vowell visits locations immortalized and influenced by the spilling of politically important blood, reporting as she goes with her trademark blend of wisecracking humor, remarkable honesty, and thought-provoking criticism. We learn about the jinx that was Robert Todd Lincoln (present at the assassinations of Presidents Lincoln, Garfield, and McKinley) and witness the politicking that went into the making of the Lincoln Memorial. The resulting narrative is much more than an entertaining and informative travelogue—it is the disturbing and fascinating story of how American death has been manipulated by popular culture, including literature, architecture, sculpture, and—the author's favorite— historical tourism. Though the themes of loss and violence are explored and we make detours to see how the Republican Party became the Republican Party, there are all kinds of lighter diversions along the way into the lives of the three presidents and their assassins, including mummies, show tunes, mean-spirited totem poles, and a nineteenth-century biblical sex cult.","#<Hashie::Mash best_book_id=3110 books_count=16 default_chaptering_book_id=nil default_description_language_code=nil desc_user_id=-30 id=824686 media_type=""book"" original_language_id=nil original_publication_day=nil original_publication_month=nil original_publication_year=2005 original_title=""Assassination Vacation"" rating_dist=""5:9325|4:12253|3:5801|2:1276|1:423|total:29078"" ratings_count=29078 ratings_sum=116015 reviews_count=47604 text_reviews_count=2878>",270,Paperback,http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3110.Assassination_Vacation,http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3110.Assassination_Vacation,,

And it was her own personal journey that inspired Elle Luna to write a brief online manifesto that, in a few short months, has touched hundreds of thousands of people who’ve read it or heard Elle speak on the topic. Now Ms. Luna expands her ideas into an inspirational, highly visual gift book for every recent graduate, every artist, every seeker, every career changer.<br><br> The Crossroads of Should and Must has a universal message—we get to choose the path between Should and Must. And it gives every reader permission to embrace this message. It’s about the difference between jobs, careers, and callings. The difference between going to work and becoming one with your work. Why knowing what you want is often the hardest part. It gives eye-opening techniques for reconnecting with one’s inner voice, like writing your own obituary (talk about putting life in perspective). It talks about the most common fears of choosing Must over Should—money, time, <strong>space</strong>, and the ultimate fear: total vulnerability—and shores up our hesitation with inspiring stories of and quotes from the artists and writers and thinkers who’ve faced their own crossroads of Should and Must and taken the leap. It explains the importance of mistakes, of “unlearning,” of solitude, of keeping moving, of following a soul path.<br><br> Presented in four chapters—The Crossroads, The <strong>Origin</strong> of Should, <strong>Must</strong>, and The Return—inspired by the hero’s journey outlined by Joseph Campbell, <strong>The Crossroads of Should and Must guides</strong> us from the small moment, discovering our Must, to the big moment—actually doing something about it, and returning to share our new gifts with the world.<br>","#<Hashie::Mash best_book_id=22859551 books_count=2 default_chaptering_book_id=nil default_description_language_code=nil desc_user_id=-44 id=42427467 media_type=nil original_language_id=nil original_publication_day=7 original_publication_month=4 original_publication_year=2015 original_title=nil rating_dist=""5:268|4:202|3:70|2:14|1:3|total:557"" ratings_count=557 ratings_sum=2389 reviews_count=2169 text_reviews_count=99>",176,Hardcover,http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22859551-the-crossroads-of-should-and-must,http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22859551-the-crossroads-of-should-and-must,,

It is now abundantly clear that Sacks has never stopped going. From its opening pages on his youthful obsession with motorcycles and speed, <em>On the Move</em> is infused with his restless energy. As he recounts his experiences as a young neurologist in the early 1960s, first in California, where he struggled with drug addiction and then in New York, where he discovered a long-forgotten illness in the back wards of a chronic hospital, we see how his engagement with patients comes to define his life.<br><br>With unbridled honesty and humor, Sacks shows us that the same energy that drives his physical passions--weight lifting and swimming--also drives his cerebral passions. He writes about his love affairs, both romantic and intellectual; his guilt over leaving his family to come to America; his bond with his schizophrenic brother; and the writers and scientists--Thom Gunn, A. R. Luria, W. H. Auden, Gerald M.
