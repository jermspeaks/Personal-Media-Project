Those are all just excuses. <br><br> What you really need to do is stop talking and start working. This book shows you the way. You'll learn how to be more productive, how to get exposure without breaking the bank, and tons more counterintuitive ideas that will inspire and provoke you.<br><br>With its straightforward language and easy-is-better approach, <em>Rework </em>is the perfect playbook for anyone who’s ever dreamed of doing it on their own.
