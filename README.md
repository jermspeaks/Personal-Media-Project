# Personal Media Project

Jeremy's personal media project. Every film I've watched since January 2010. Every book I've read since Summer of 2010. Logging every piece of entertainment read, watched, and listened to. Determining ways of automation for logging these events.

## Movies

I created a markdown version of my list I've been manually adding for years. I also converted it into a csv file via some ruby scripts that you can find here as well.

* [Markdown File](./Movies/watched-movies.md)
* [CSV File](./Movies/watched-movies.csv)

## Books

* [Markdown File](./Books/read-books.md)
* [CSV File](./Books/books.csv)

## Web App Interface

I'm currently testing out React with Flux right now. I'm trying to figure out how to get Webpack to play nice with Flux and it's going to be a learning curve. Thankfully there's enough tutorials to help get me started.
