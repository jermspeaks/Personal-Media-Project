If you're looking for a book like that, put this one back on the shelf.<br><br><em>Rework </em>shows you a better, faster, easier way to succeed in business. Read it and you'll know why plans are actually harmful, why you don't need outside investors, and why you're better off ignoring the competition.\u00a0The truth is, you need less than you think. You don't need to be a workaholic. You don't need to staff up. You don't need to waste time on paperwork or meetings. You don't even need an office. Those are all just excuses.\u00a0<br><br> What you really need to do is stop talking and start working. This book shows you the way. You'll learn how to be more productive, how to get exposure without breaking the bank, and tons more counterintuitive ideas that will inspire and provoke you.<br><br>With its straightforward language and easy-is-better approach, <em>Rework </em>is the perfect playbook for anyone who\u2019s ever dreamed of doing it on their own. Hardcore entrepreneurs, small-business owners, people stuck in day jobs they hate, victims of \"downsizing,\" and artists who don\u2019t want to starve anymore will all find valuable guidance in these pages.",

As they endure the ever escalating dangers around them\u2014in their home as well as in the streets of Kabul\u2014they come to form a bond that makes them both sisters and mother-daughter to each other, and that will ultimately alter the course not just of their own lives but of the next generation. With heart-wrenching power and suspense, Hosseini shows how a woman\u2019s love for her family can move her to shocking and heroic acts of self-sacrifice, and that in the end it is love, or even the memory of love, that is often the key to survival.<br><br>A stunning accomplishment, A Thousand Splendid Suns is a haunting, heartbreaking, compelling story of an unforgiving time, an unlikely friendship, and an indestructible love.",

Can a person think herself to orgasm? Can a dead man get an erection? Is vaginal orgasm a myth? Why doesn't Viagra help women or, for that matter, pandas? <br><br>In 'Bonk', Roach shows us how and why sexual arousal and orgasm, two of the most complex, delightful, and amazing scientific phenomena on earth, can be so hard to achieve and what science is doing to slowly make the bedroom a more satisfying place. 16 illustrations.",

A tart-tongued mother does dead-on imitations of her young son's nervous tics, to the great amusement of his teachers; a stint of Kerouackian wandering is undertaken (of course!) with a quadriplegic companion; a family gathers for a wedding in the face of imminent death. Through it all is Sedaris's unmistakable voice, without doubt one of the freshest in American writing.",

        "description": "The tipping point is that magic moment when an idea, trend, or social behavior crosses a threshold, tips, and spreads like wildfire. Just as a single sick person can start an epidemic of the flu, so too can a small but precisely targeted push cause a fashion trend, the popularity of a new product, or a drop in the crime rate. This widely acclaimed bestseller, in which Malcolm Gladwell explores and brilliantly illuminates the tipping point phenomenon, is already changing the way people throughout the world think about selling products and disseminating ideas.<br><br>Gladwell introduces us to the particular personality types who are natural pollinators of new ideas and trends, the people who create the phenomenon of word of mouth. He analyzes fashion trends, smoking, children's television, direct mail, and the early days of the American Revolution for clues about making ideas infectious, and visits a religious commune, a successful high-tech company, and one of the world's greatest salesmen to show how to start and sustain social epidemics.",

        "description": "From the bestselling author of \"The Know-It-All\" comes a fascinating and timely exploration of religion and the Bible.Raised in a secular family but increasingly interested in the relevance of faith in our modern world, A.J. Jacobs decides to dive in headfirst and attempt to obey the Bible as literally as possible for one full year. He vows to follow the Ten Commandments. To be fruitful and multiply. To love his neighbor. But also to obey the hundreds of less publicized rules: to avoid wearing clothes made of mixed fibers; to play a ten-string harp; to stone adulterers.<br><br>The resulting spiritual journey is at once funny and profound, reverent and irreverent, personal and universal and will make you see history's most influential book with new eyes.<br><br>Jacobs's quest transforms his life even more radically than the year spent reading the entire \"Encyclopedia Britannica\" for \"The Know-It-All.\" His beard grows so unruly that he is regularly mistaken for a member of ZZ Top. He immerses himself in prayer, tends sheep in the Israeli desert, battles idolatry, and tells the absolute truth in all situations - much to his wife's chagrin.<br><br>Throughout the book, Jacobs also embeds himself in a cross-section of communities that take the Bible literally. He tours a Kentucky-based creationist museum and sings hymns with Pennsylvania Amish. He dances with Hasidic Jews in Brooklyn and does Scripture study with Jehovah's Witnesses. He discovers ancient biblical wisdom of startling relevance. And he wrestles with seemingly archaic rules that baffle the twenty-first-century brain.Jacobs's extraordinary undertaking yields unexpected epiphanies and challenges. A book that will charm readers both secular and religious, \"The Year of Living Biblically\" is part Cliff Notes to the Bible, part memoir, and part look into worlds unimaginable. Thou shalt not be able to put it down.",

[It] was due the next day. We were out at our family cabin in Bolinas, and he was at the kitchen table close to tears, surrounded by binder paper and pencils and unopened books on birds, immobilized by the hugeness of the task ahead. Then my father sat down beside him, put his arm around my brother's shoulder, and said. 'Bird by bird, buddy. Just take it bird by bird.'\"<p>With this basic instruction always in mind, Anne Lamott returns to offer us a new gift: a step-by-step guide on how to write and on how to manage the writer's life. From \"Getting Started,' with \"Short Assignments,\" through \"Shitty First Drafts,\" \"Character,\" \"Plot,\" \"Dialogue.\" all the way from \"False Starts\" to \"How Do You Know When You're Done?\" Lamott encourages, instructs, and inspires. She discusses \"Writers Block,\" \"Writing Groups,\" and \"Publication.\" Bracingly honest, she is also one of the funniest people alive.</p><p>If you have ever wondered what it takes to be a writer, what it means to be a writer, what the contents of your school lunches said about what your parents were really like, this book is for you. From faith, love, and grace to pain, jealousy, and fear, Lamott insists that you keep your eyes open, and then shows you how to survive. And always, from the life of the artist she turns to the art of life.</p>",

But why are he and his faithful companion, the often testy male monkey Ampersand, still alive? He sets out to find the answer (and his girlfriend), while running from angry female Republicans (now running the government), Amazon wannabes that include his own sister (seemingly brainwashed), and other threats. The Vertigo team of Brian K. Vaughan, Pia Guerra, and Jose Marzan Jr. have given us a great read!",

        "description": "In their 2007 bestseller, <em>Wikinomics</em> Don Tapscott and Anthony Williams showed the world how mass collaboration was changing the way businesses communicate, create value, and compete in the new global marketplace. Now, in the wake of the global financial crisis, the principles of wikinomics have become more powerful than ever. <br><br> Many of the institutions that have served us well for decades or centuries seem stuck in the past and unable to move forward. And yet, in every corner of the globe, a powerful new model of economic and social innovation is sweeping across all sectors-one where people with drive, passion, and expertise take advantage of new Web-based tools to get more involved in making the world more prosperous, just, and sustainable. <br><br> Tapscott and Williams show that in over a dozen fields-from finance to health care, science to education, the media to the environment-we have reached a historic turning point: cling to the old industrial-era paradigms or use collaborative innovation to revolutionize not only the way we work, but how we live, learn, create, govern, and care for one another. You'll meet innovators such as: <br><br> * An Iraq veteran whose start-up car company is \"staffed\" by over 4,500 competing designers and supplied by microfactories around the world <br> * A microlending community where 570,000 individuals help fund new ventures-from Angola to Vietnam <br> * An online community for people with life-altering diseases that also serves as a large-scale research project <br> * An astronomer who is mapping the universe with the help of 250,000 citizen scientists <br><br> Tapscott and Williams once again use original research to provide vivid new examples of organizations that are successfully embracing the principles of wikinomics to change the world. <br><br> Visit <a href=\"http://www.Macrowikinomics.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.Macrowikinomics.com</a>.",

        "description": "<strong>Urban and rural collide in this wry, inspiring memoir of a woman who turned a vacant lot in downtown Oakland into a thriving farm</strong><br><br>Novella Carpenter loves cities-the culture, the crowds, the energy. At the same time, she can't shake the fact that she is the daughter of two back-to-the-land hippies who taught her to love nature and eat vegetables. Ambivalent about repeating her parents' disastrous mistakes, yet drawn to the idea of backyard self-sufficiency, Carpenter decided that it might be possible to have it both ways: a homegrown vegetable plot as well as museums, bars, concerts, and a twenty-four-hour convenience mart mere minutes away. Especially when she moved to a ramshackle house in inner city Oakland and discovered a weed-choked, garbage-strewn abandoned lot next door. She closed her eyes and pictured heirloom tomatoes, a beehive, and a chicken coop.<br><br> What started out as a few egg-laying chickens led to turkeys, geese, and ducks. Soon, some rabbits joined the fun, then two three-hundred-pound pigs. And no, these charming and eccentric animals weren't pets; she was a farmer, not a zookeeper. Novella was raising these animals for dinner. Novella Carpenter's corner of downtown Oakland is populated by unforgettable characters. Lana (<em>anal</em> spelled backward, she reminds us) runs a speakeasy across the street and refuses to hurt even a fly, let alone condone raising turkeys for Thanksgiving. Bobby, the homeless man who collects cars and car parts just outside the farm, is an invaluable neighborhood concierge. The turkeys, Harold and Maude, tend to escape on a daily basis to cavort with the prostitutes hanging around just off the highway nearby. Every day on this strange and beautiful farm, urban meets rural in the most surprising ways.<br><br> For anyone who has ever grown herbs on their windowsill, tomatoes on their fire escape, or obsessed over the offerings at the local farmers' market, Carpenter's story will capture your heart. And if you've ever considered leaving it all behind to become a farmer outside the city limits, or looked at the abandoned lot next door with a gleam in your eye, consider this both a cautionary tale and a full-throated call to action.<em> Farm City</em> is an unforgettably charming memoir, full of hilarious moments, fascinating farmers' tips, and a great deal of heart. It is also a moving meditation on urban life versus the natural world and what we have given up to live the way we do.",

        "description": "What should we have for dinner?\" To one degree or another this simple question assails any creature faced with a wide choice of things to eat. Anthropologists call it the omnivore's dilemma. Choosing from among the countless potential foods nature offers, humans have had to learn what is safe, and what isn't\u2014which mushrooms should be avoided, for example, and which berries we can enjoy. Today, as America confronts what can only be described as a national eating disorder, the omnivore's dilemma has returned with an atavistic vengeance. The cornucopia of the modern American supermarket and fast-food outlet has thrown us back on a bewildering landscape where we once again have to worry about which of those tasty-looking morsels might kill us. At the same time we're realizing that our food choices also have profound implications for the health of our environment. <em>The Omnivore's Dilemma</em> is bestselling author Michael Pollan's brilliant and eye-opening exploration of these little-known but vitally important dimensions of eating in America.<br><br> Pollan has divided <em>The Omnivore's Dilemma</em> into three parts, one for each of the food chains that sustain us: industrialized food, alternative or \"organic\" food, and food people obtain by dint of their own hunting, gathering, or gardening. Pollan follows each food chain literally from the ground up to the table, emphasizing our dynamic coevolutionary relationship with the species we depend on. He concludes each section by sitting down to a meal\u2014at McDonald's, at home with his family sharing a dinner from Whole Foods, and in a revolutionary \"beyond organic\" farm in Virginia. For each meal he traces the provenance of everything consumed, revealing the hidden components we unwittingly ingest and explaining how our taste for particular foods reflects our environmental and biological inheritance.<br><br> We are indeed what we eat-and what we eat remakes the world. A society of voracious and increasingly confused omnivores, we are just beginning to recognize the profound consequences of the simplest everyday food choices, both for ourselves and for the natural world. <em>The Omnivore's Dilemma</em> is a long-overdue book and one that will become known for bringing a completely fresh perspective to a question as ordinary and yet momentous as What shall we have for dinner?<br><br>A few facts and figures from <em>The Omnivore's Dilemma</em>:<br>Of the 38 ingredients it takes to make a McNugget, there are at least 13 that are derived from corn. 45 different menu items at Mcdonald\u2019s are made from corn. One in every three American children eats fast food every day. One in every five American meals today is eaten in the car. The food industry burns nearly a fifth of all the petroleum consumed in the United States\u2014more than we burn with our cars and more than any other industry consumes. It takes ten calories of fossil fuel energy to deliver one calorie of food energy to an American plate. A single strawberry contains about five calories. To get that strawberry from a field in California to a plate on the east coast requires 435 calories of energy. Industrial fertilizer and industrial pesticides both owe their existence to the conversion of the World War II munitions industry to civilian uses\u2014nerve gases became pesticides, and ammonium nitrate explosives became nitrogen fertilizers. ...",

This internationally acclaimed novel looks at the world through the eyes of Jess Goldberg, a masculine girl growing up in the \"Ozzie and Harriet\" McCarthy era and coming out as a young butch lesbian in the pre-Stonewall gay drag bars of a blue-collar town. Stone Butch Blues traces a propulsive journey, powerfully evoking history and politics while portraying an extraordinary protagonist full of longing, vulnerability, and working-class grit. This once-underground classic takes the reader on a roller-coaster ride of gender transformation and exploration and ultimately speaks to the heart of anyone who has ever suffered or gloried in being different.",

This wise and rapturous book is the story of how she left behind all these outward marks of success, and of what she found in their place. Following a divorce and a crushing depression, Gilbert set out to examine three different aspects of her nature, set against the backdrop of three different cultures: pleasure in Italy, devotion in India, and on the Indonesian island of Bali, a balance between worldly enjoyment and divine transcendence.",

        "book_title": "Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking",
        "description": "In his landmark bestseller <em>The Tipping Point</em>, Malcolm Gladwell redefined how we understand the world around us. Now, in <em>Blink</em>, he revolutionizes the way we understand the world within. <em>Blink</em> is a book about how we think without thinking, about choices that seem to be made in an instant--in the blink of an eye--that actually aren't as simple as they seem. Why are some people brilliant decision makers, while others are consistently inept? Why do some people follow their instincts and win, while others end up stumbling into error? How do our brains really work-in the office, in the classroom, in the kitchen, and in the bedroom? And why are the best decisions often those that are impossible to explain to others?<p>In <em>Blink</em> we meet the psychologist who has learned to predict whether a marriage will last, based on a few minutes of observing a couple; the tennis coach who knows when a player will double-fault before the racket even makes contact with the ball; the antiquities experts who recognize a fake at a glance. Here, too, are great failures of \"blink\": the election of Warren Harding; \"New Coke\"; and the shooting of Amadou Diallo by police. <em>Blink</em> reveals that great decision makers aren't those who process the most information or spend the most time deliberating, but those who have perfected the art of \"thin-slicing\"--filtering the very few factors that matter from an overwhelming number of variables.<br><br><em>Contents</em><br><br>Introduction: The statue that didn\u00b4t look right<br>1.

        "description": "Ekhart Tolle's message is simple: living in the now is the truest path to happiness and enlightenment. And while this message may not seem stunningly original or fresh, Tolle's clear writing, supportive voice and enthusiasm make this an excellent manual for anyone who's ever wondered what exactly \"living in the now\" means. Foremost, Tolle is a world-class teacher, able to explain complicated concepts in concrete language. More importantly, within a chapter of reading this book, readers are already holding the world in a different container--more conscious of how thoughts and emotions get in the way of their ability to live in genuine peace and happiness.<p>Tolle packs a lot of information and inspirational ideas into <em>The Power of Now</em>. (Topics include the source of Chi, enlightened relationships, creative use of the mind, impermanence and the cycle of life.) Thankfully, he's added markers that symbolise \"break time\". This is when readers should close the book and mull over what they just read. As a result, <em>The Power of Now</em> reads like the highly acclaimed <em>A Course in Miracles</em>--a spiritual guidebook that has the potential to inspire just as many study groups and change just as many lives for the better. --<em>Gail Hudson</em></p>",

These pieces, dedicated to classical and popular<em> </em>artists alike, are at once erudite and lively. In a previously unpublished<em> </em>essay, Ross brilliantly retells hundreds of years of music<em> </em>history-from Renaissance dances to Led Zeppelin-through a few<em> </em>iconic bass lines of celebration and lament. He vibrantly sketches<em> </em>canonical composers such as Schubert, Verdi, and Brahms; gives<em> </em>us in-depth interviews with modern pop masters such as Bj\u00f6rk<em> </em>and Radiohead; and introduces us to music students at a Newark<em> </em>high school and indie-rock hipsters in Beijing.<br><br>Whether his subject is Mozart or Bob Dylan, Ross shows how music expresses the full complexity of the human condition.

        "book_title": "Cradle to Cradle: Remaking the Way We Make Things",
        "description": "\"Reduce, reuse, recycle,\" urge environmentalists; in other words, do more with less in order to minimize damage. But as architect William McDonough and chemist Michael Braungart point out in this provocative, visionary book, such an approach only perpetuates the one-way, \"cradle to grave\" manufacturing model, dating to the Industrial Revolution, that creates such fantastic amounts of waste and pollution in the first place. Why not challenge the belief that human industry must damage the natural world? In fact, why not take nature itself as our model for making things? A tree produces thousands of blossoms in order to create another tree, yet we consider its abundance not wasteful but safe, beautiful, and highly effective.<br><br><strong>Waste equals food.</strong><br><br>Guided by this principle, McDonough and Braungart explain how products can be designed from the outset so that, after their useful lives, they will provide nourishment for something new. They can be conceived as \"biological nutrients\" that will easily reenter the water or soil without depositing synthetic materials and toxins. Or they can be \"technical nutrients\" that will continually circulate as pure and valuable materials within closed-loop industrial cycles, rather than being \"recycled\" -- really, downcycled -- into low-grade materials and uses. Drawing on their experience in (re)designing everything from carpeting to corporate campuses, McDonough and Braungart make an exciting and viable case for putting eco-effectiveness into practice, and show how anyone involved with making anything can begin to do as well. <br><br><strong>William McDonough</strong> is an architect and the founding principal of William McDonough + Partners, Architecture and Community Design, based in Charlottesville, Virginia. From 1994 to 1999 he served as dean of the school of architecture at the University of Virginia. In 1999 <em>Time</em> magazine recognized him as a \"Hero for the Planet,\" stating that \"his utopianism is grounded in a unified philosophy that -- in demonstrable and practical ways -- is changing the design of the world.\" In 1996, he received the Presidential Award for Sustainable Development, the highest environmental honor given by the United States.<br><br><strong>Michael Braungart</strong> is a chemist and the founder of the Environmental Protection Encouragement Agency (EPEA) in Hamburg, Germany. Prior to starting EPEA, he was the director of the chemistry section for Greenpeace. Since 1984 he has been lecturing at universities, businesses, and institutions around the world on critical new concepts for ecological chemistry and materials flow management. Dr. Braungart is the recipient of numerous honors, awards, and fellowships from the Heinz Endowment, the W. Alton Jones Foundation, and other organizations.<br><br>In 1995 the authors created McDonough Braungart Design Chemistry, a product and systems development firm assisting client companies in implementing their unique sustaining design protocol. Their clients include Ford Motor Company, Nike, Herman Miller, BASF, DesignTex, Pendleton, Volvo, and the city of Chicago.",

        "description": "Many think of 1776 as the defining year of American history, when we became a nation devoted to the pursuit of happiness through self- government. In <em>Unfamiliar Fishes,</em> Sarah Vowell argues that 1898 might be a year just as defining, when, in an orgy of imperialism, the United States annexed Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and Guam, and invaded first Cuba, then the Philippines, becoming an international superpower practically overnight.<br><br>Among the developments in these outposts of 1898, Vowell considers the Americanization of Hawaii the most intriguing. From the arrival of New England missionaries in 1820, their goal to Christianize the local heathen, to the coup d'\u00e9tat of the missionaries' sons in 1893, which overthrew the Hawaiian queen, the events leading up to American annexation feature a cast of beguiling, and often appealing or tragic, characters: whalers who fired cannons at the Bible-thumpers denying them their God-given right to whores, an incestuous princess pulled between her new god and her brother-husband, sugar barons, lepers, con men, Theodore Roosevelt, and the last Hawaiian queen, a songwriter whose sentimental ode \"Aloha 'Oe\" serenaded the first Hawaiian president of the United States during his 2009 inaugural parade.<br><br>With her trademark smart-alecky insights and reporting, Vowell lights out to discover the off, emblematic, and exceptional history of the fiftieth state, and in so doing finds America, warts and all.",

But in her version, Atwood brilliantly recasts the monster as Zenia, a villainess of demonic proportions, and sets her loose in the lives of three friends, Tony,\u00a0 Charis, and Roz. All three \"have lost men, spirit, money, and time to their old college acquaintance, Zenia. At various times, and in various emotional disguises, Zenia has insinuated her way into their lives and practically demolished them. To Tony, who almost lost her husband and jeopardized her academic career, Zenia is 'a lurking enemy\u00a0\u00a0commando.' To Roz, who did lose her husband and almost her magazine, Zenia is 'a cold and treacherous bitch.' To Charis, who lost a boyfriend, quarts of vegetable juice and some pet chickens, Zenia is a kind of zombie, maybe 'soulless'\" (Lorrie Moore, <em>New York Times Book\u00a0\u00a0Review</em>). In love and war, illusion and deceit, Zenia's subterranean malevolence takes us deep into her enemies' pasts.",

        "description": "Written with full cooperation from top management, including cofounders Sergey Brin and Larry Page, this is the inside story behind Google, the most successful and most admired technology company of our time, told by one of our best technology writers.<br><br>Few companies in history have ever been as successful and as admired as Google, the company that has transformed the Internet and become an indispensable part of our lives. How has Google done it? Veteran technology reporter Steven Levy was granted unprecedented access to the company, and in this revelatory book he takes readers inside Google headquarters&amp;#8212;the Googleplex&amp;#8212;to show how Google works.<br><br> While they were still students at Stanford, Google cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin revolutionized Internet search. They followed this brilliant innovation with another, as two of Google&amp;#8217;s earliest employees found a way to do what no one else had: make billions of dollars from Internet advertising. With this cash cow, Google was able to expand dramatically and take on other transformative projects: more efficient data centers, open-source cell phones, free Internet video (YouTube), cloud computing, digitizing books, and much more.<br><br> The key to Google&amp;#8217;s success in all these businesses, Levy reveals, is its engineering mind-set and adoption of such Internet values as speed, openness, experimentation, and risk taking. After its unapologetically elitist approach to hiring, Google pampers its engineers&amp;#8212;free food and dry cleaning, on-site doctors and masseuses&amp;#8212;and gives them all the resources they need to succeed. Even today, with a workforce of more than 23,000, Larry Page signs off on every hire.<br><br> But has Google lost its innovative edge? With its newest initiative, social networking, Google is chasing a successful competitor for the first time. Some employees are leaving the company for smaller, nimbler start-ups. Can the company that famously decided not to be evil still compete?<br><br> No other book has ever turned Google inside out as Levy does with <em>In the Plex</em>.",

His boyfriend, Terry, says \"no thanks\" because he doesn't want to act like a straight person. Their six-year-old son DJ says his two dads aren't \"allowed\" to get married, but that he'd like to come to the reception and eat cake.

        "description": "<em>The Rest Is Noise: Listening to the Twentieth Century</em> is a voyage into the labyrinth of modern music, which remains an obscure world for most people. While paintings of Picasso and Jackson Pollock sell for a hundred million dollars or more, and lines from T. S. Eliot are quoted on the yearbook pages of alienated teenagers across the land, twentieth-century classical music still sends ripples of unease through audiences. At the same time, its influence can be felt everywhere. Atonal chords crop up in jazz. Avant-garde sounds populate the soundtracks of Hollywood thrillers. Minimalism has had a huge effect on rock, pop, and dance music from the Velvet Underground onward.<br><br><em>The Rest Is Noise</em> shows why twentieth-century composers felt compelled to create a famously bewildering variety of sounds, from the purest beauty to the purest noise. It tells of a remarkable array of maverick personalities who resisted the cult of the classical past, struggled against the indifference of a wide public, and defied the will of dictators. Whether they have charmed audiences with sweet sounds or battered them with dissonance, composers have always been exuberantly of the present, defying the stereotype of classical music as a dying art. The narrative goes from Vienna before the First World War to Paris in the twenties, from Hitler's Germany and Stalin's Russia to downtown New  York in the sixties and seventies. We follow the rise of mass culture and mass politics, of dramatic new technologies, of hot and cold wars, of experiments, revolutions, riots, and friendships forged and broken. The end result is not so much a history of twentieth-century music as a history of the twentieth century through its music.",

With penetrating insight and sparkling prose, Gilbert explains why we seem to know so little about the hearts and minds of the people we are about to become.",

        "description": "A million copy seller, Henry Hazlitt\u2019s <em>Economics in One Lesson</em> is a classic economic primer. But it is also much more, having become a fundamental influence on modern \u201clibertarian\u201d economics of the type espoused by Ron Paul and others.<br><br>Considered among the leading economic thinkers of the \u201cAustrian School,\u201d which includes Carl Menger, Ludwig von Mises, Friedrich (F.A.) Hayek, and others, Henry Hazlitt (1894-1993), was a libertarian philosopher, an economist, and a journalist. He was the founding vice-president of the Foundation for Economic Education and an early editor of <em>The Freeman</em> magazine, an influential libertarian publication.\u00a0 Hazlitt wrote <em>Economics in One Lesson</em>, his seminal work, in 1946. Concise and instructive, it is also deceptively prescient and far-reaching in its efforts to dissemble economic fallacies that are so prevalent they have almost become a new orthodoxy.<br><br>Many current economic commentators across the political spectrum have credited Hazlitt with foreseeing the collapse of the global economy which occurred more than 50 years after the initial publication of <em>Economics in One Lesson</em>. Hazlitt\u2019s focus on non-governmental solutions, strong \u2014 and strongly reasoned \u2014 anti-deficit position, and general emphasis on free markets, economic liberty of individuals, and the dangers of government intervention make <em>Economics in One Lesson</em>, every bit as relevant and valuable today as it has been since publication.",

System 1 is fast, intuitive, and emotional; System 2 is slower, more deliberative, and more logical. Kahneman exposes the extraordinary capabilities\u2014and also the faults and biases\u2014of fast thinking, and reveals the pervasive influence of intuitive impressions on our thoughts and behavior. The impact of loss aversion and overconfidence on corporate strategies, the difficulties of predicting what will make us happy in the future, the challenges of properly framing risks at work and at home, the profound effect of cognitive biases on everything from playing the stock market to planning the next vacation\u2014each of these can be understood only by knowing how the two systems work together to shape our judgments and decisions.<br><br>Engaging the reader in a lively conversation about how we think, Kahneman reveals where we can and cannot trust our intuitions and how we can tap into the benefits of slow thinking. He offers practical and enlightening insights into how choices are made in both our business and our personal lives\u2014and how we can use different techniques to guard against the mental glitches that often get us into trouble. <em>Thinking, Fast and Slow</em> will transform the way you think about thinking.",

After years of scanning the galaxy for signs of somebody or something else, this team believes they've found a message from an intelligent source--and they travel deep into space to meet it. Pulitzer Prize winner Carl Sagan injects <em>Contact</em>, his prophetic adventure story, with scientific details that make it utterly believable. It's a Cold War era novel that parlays the nuclear paranoia of the time into exquisitely wrought tension among the various countries involved. Sagan meditates on science, religion and government--the elements that define society--and looks to their impact on and role in the future. His ability to pack an exciting read with such rich content is an unusual talent that makes <em>Contact</em> a modern sci-fi classic.",

        "description": "A brain scientist's journey from a debilitating stroke to full recovery becomes an inspiring exploration of human consciousness and its possibilities<br><br> On the morning of December 10, 1996, Jill Bolte Taylor, a thirty-seven-year-old Harvard-trained brain scientist, experienced a massive stroke when a blood vessel exploded in the left side of her brain. A neuroanatomist by profession, she observed her own mind completely deteriorate to the point that she could not walk, talk, read, write, or recall any of her life, all within the space of four brief hours. As the damaged left side of her brain--the rational, grounded, detail- and time-oriented side--swung in and out of function, Taylor alternated between two distinct and opposite realities: the euphoric nirvana of the intuitive and kinesthetic right brain, in which she felt a sense of complete well-being and peace; and the logical, sequential left brain, which recognized Jill was having a stroke, and enabled her to seek help before she was lost completely.<br><br> In <em>My Stroke of Insight</em>, Taylor shares her unique perspective on the brain and its capacity for recovery, and the sense of omniscient understanding she gained from this unusual and inspiring voyage out of the abyss of a wounded brain. It would take eight years for Taylor to heal completely. Because of her knowledge of how the brain works, her respect for the cells composing her human form, and most of all an amazing mother, Taylor completely repaired her mind and recalibrated her understanding of the world according to the insights gained from her right brain that morning of December 10th.  <br><br> Today Taylor is convinced that the stroke was the best thing that could have happened to her. It has taught her that the feeling of nirvana is never more than a mere thought away. By <em>stepping to the right of our left brains</em>, we can all uncover the feelings of well-being and peace that are so often sidelined by our own brain chatter. A fascinating journey into the mechanics of the human mind, <em>My Stroke of Insight</em> is both a valuable recovery guide for anyone touched by a brain injury, and an emotionally stirring testimony that deep internal peace truly is accessible to anyone, at any time.",

Arguing that the processes creating the technium are akin to those of biological evolution, Kelly devotes the opening sections of his exposition to that analogy, maintaining that the technium exhibits a similar tendency toward self-organizing complexity. Having defined the technium, Kelly addresses its discontents, as expressed by the Unabomber (although Kelly admits to trepidation in taking seriously the antitechnology screeds of a murderer) and then as lived by the allegedly technophobic Amish. From his observations and discussions with some Amish people, Kelly extracts some precepts of their attitudes toward gadgets, suggesting folk in the secular world can benefit from the Amish approach of treating tools as servants of self and society rather than as out-of-control masters. Exploring ramifications of technology on human welfare and achievement, Kelly arrives at an optimistic outlook that will interest many, coming, as it does, from the former editor of Wired magazine.\"<br><br>Gilbert Taylor, Booklist",

You\u2019re just as deluded as the rest of us--but that\u2019s okay, because being deluded is part of being human. <br><br>Growing out of David McRaney\u2019s popular blog, <em>You Are Not So Smart</em> reveals that every decision we make, every thought we contemplate, and every emotion we feel comes with a story we tell ourselves to explain them, but often these stories aren\u2019t true. Each short chapter--covering topics such as Learned Helplessness, Selling Out, and the Illusion of Transparency--is like a psychology course with all the boring parts taken out.<br><br>Bringing together popular science and psychology with humor and wit, <em>You Are Not So Smart</em> is a celebration of our irrational, thoroughly human behavior.",

        "description": "From farmer Joel Salatin's point of view, life in the 21st century just ain't normal. In FOLKS, THIS AIN'T NORMAL, he discusses how far removed we are from the simple, sustainable joy that comes from living close to the land and the people we love. Salatin has many thoughts on what normal is and shares practical and philosophical ideas for changing our lives in small ways that have big impact.<br><br>Salatin, hailed by the <em>New York Times</em> as \"Virginia's most multifaceted agrarian since Thomas Jefferson [and] the high priest of the pasture\" and profiled in the Academy Award nominated documentary <em>Food, Inc.</em> and the bestselling book <em>The Omnivore's Dilemma</em>, understands what food should be: Wholesome, seasonal, raised naturally, procured locally, prepared lovingly, and eaten with a profound reverence for the circle of life. And his message doesn't stop there. From child-rearing, to creating quality family time, to respecting the environment, Salatin writes with a wicked sense of humor and true storyteller's knack for the revealing anecdote. <br><br>Salatin's crucial message and distinctive voice--practical, provocative, scientific, and down-home philosophical in equal measure--make FOLKS, THIS AIN'T NORMAL a must-read book.",

        "description": "Weiner spent a decade as a foreign correspondent reporting from such discontented locales as Iraq, Afghanistan, and Indonesia. Unhappy people living in profoundly unstable states, he notes, inspire pathos and make for good copy, but not for good karma. So Weiner, admitted grump and self-help book aficionado, undertook a year's research to travel the globe, looking for the \"unheralded happy places.\" The result is this book, equal parts laugh-out-loud funny and philosophical, a journey into both the definition of and the destination for true contentment.<br><br>Apparently, the happiest places on earth include, somewhat unexpectedly, Iceland, Bhutan, and India. Weiner also visits the country deemed most malcontent, Moldova, and finds real merit in the claim.<br><br>But the question remains: What makes people happy? Is it the freedom of the West or the myriad restrictions of Singapore? The simple ashrams of India or the glittering shopping malls of Qatar?<br>From the youthful drunkenness of Iceland to the despond of Slough, a sad but resilient town in Heathrow's flight path, Weiner offers wry yet profound observations about the way people relate to circumstance and fate.<br><br>Both revealing and inspirational, perhaps the best thing about this hilarious trip across four continents is that for the reader, the \"geography of bliss\" is wherever they happen to find themselves while reading it.",

A completely practical approach delivered with a nonjudgmental style that makes readers want to do what Sethi says, it is based around the four pillars of personal finance--banking, saving, budgeting, and investing--and the wealth-building ideas of personal entrepreneurship.<br><br> Sethi covers how to save time by not wasting it managing money; the guns and cars myth of credit cards; how to negotiate like an Indian--the conversation <em>begins</em> with \"no\"; why \"Budgeting Doesn't Have to Suck!\"; how to get things rolling--for real--with only $20; what most people don't understand about taxes; how to get a CEO to take <em>you</em> out to lunch; how to avoid the Super Mario Brothers trap by making your savings work harder than you do; the difference between cheap and frugal; the hidden relationship between money and food. Not to mention his first key lesson: Getting started is more important than being the smartest person in the room. Integrated with his website, where readers can use interactive charts, follow up on the latest information, and join the community, it is a hip blueprint to building wealth and financial security.<br><br>Every month, 175,000 unique visitors come to Ramit Sethi's website, Iwillteachyoutoberich.com, to discover the path to financial freedom. They praise him thoughtfully (\"Your site summarizes everything I want with my life--to be rich in finances, rich in experience, rich in family blessings,\"\u00a0<em>Dan Esparza</em>) and effusively (\"Dude, you rock. I love this site!\" <em>Richard Wu</em>). The press has caught on, too: \"Ramit Sethi is a rising star in the world of personal finance writing . . . one singularly attuned to the sensibilities of his generation. his style is part frat boy and part silicon Valley geek, with a little bit of San Francisco hipster thrown in\" (<em>San Francisco Chronicle</em>). His writing is smart, his voice is full of attitude, and his ideas are uncommonly sound and refreshingly hype-free.",

        "description": "<strong>World-renowned Stanford University psychologist Carol Dweck, in decades of research on achievement and success, has discovered a truly groundbreaking idea\u2014the power of our mindset.</strong><br> \u00a0<br> Dweck explains why it\u2019s not just our abilities and talent that bring us success\u2014but whether we approach them with a fixed or growth mindset. She makes clear why praising intelligence and ability doesn\u2019t foster self-esteem and lead to accomplishment, but may actually jeopardize success. With the right mindset, we can motivate our kids and help them to raise their grades, as well as reach our own goals\u2014personal and professional. Dweck reveals what all great parents, teachers, CEOs, and athletes already know: how a simple idea about the brain can create a love of learning and a resilience that is the basis of great accomplishment in every area.<br> \u00a0<br><strong>Praise for <em>Mindset</em></strong><br> \u00a0<br> \u201cEveryone should read this book.\u201d<strong>\u2014Chip and Dan Heath, authors of <em>Switch</em> and <em>Made to Stick</em></strong><br> \u00a0<br> \u201cWill prove to be one of the most influential books ever about motivation.\u201d<strong>\u2014Po Bronson, author of <em>NurtureShock</em></strong><br> \u00a0<br> \u201cA good book is one whose advice you believe.

        "book_title": "Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking",
        "description": "At least one-third of the people we know are introverts. They are the ones who prefer listening to speaking, reading to partying; who innovate and create but dislike self-promotion; who favor working on their own over brainstorming in teams. Although they are often labeled \"quiet,\" it is to introverts that we owe many of the great contributions to society--from van Gogh\u2019s sunflowers to the invention of the personal computer.<br><br>Passionately argued, impressively researched, and filled with indelible stories of real people, <em>Quiet </em>shows how dramatically we undervalue introverts, and how much we lose in doing so. Taking the reader on a journey from Dale Carnegie\u2019s birthplace to Harvard Business School, from a Tony Robbins seminar to an evangelical megachurch, Susan Cain charts the rise of the Extrovert Ideal in the twentieth century and explores its far-reaching effects. She talks to Asian-American students who feel alienated from the brash, backslapping atmosphere of American schools. She questions the dominant values of American business culture, where forced collaboration can stand in the way of innovation, and where the leadership potential of introverts is often overlooked. And she draws on cutting-edge research in psychology and neuroscience to reveal the surprising differences between extroverts and introverts.<br><br>Perhaps most inspiring, she introduces us to successful introverts--from a witty, high-octane public speaker who recharges in solitude after his talks, to a record-breaking salesman who quietly taps into the power of questions. Finally, she offers invaluable advice on everything from how to better negotiate differences in introvert-extrovert relationships to how to empower an introverted child to when it makes sense to be a \"pretend extrovert.\"<br><br>This extraordinary book has the power to permanently change how we see introverts and, equally important, how introverts see themselves.",

        "description": "Benjamin Franklin is the Founding Father who winks at us. An ambitious urban entrepreneur who rose up the social ladder, from leather-aproned shopkeeper to dining with kings, he seems made of flesh rather than of marble. In bestselling author Walter Isaacson's vivid and witty full-scale biography, we discover why Franklin seems to turn to us from history's stage with eyes that twinkle from behind his new-fangled spectacles. By bringing Franklin to life, Isaacson shows how he helped to define both his own time and ours. <p> He was, during his 84-year life, America's best scientist, inventor, diplomat, writer, and business strategist, and he was also one of its most practical -- though not most profound -- political thinkers. He proved by flying a kite that lightning was electricity, and he invented a rod to tame it. He sought practical ways to make stoves less smoky and commonwealths less corrupt. He organized neighborhood constabularies and international alliances, local lending libraries and national legislatures. He combined two types of lenses to create bifocals and two concepts of representation to foster the nation's federal compromise. He was the only man who shaped all the founding documents of America: the Albany Plan of Union, the Declaration of Independence, the treaty of alliance with France, the peace treaty with England, and the Constitution. And he helped invent America's unique style of homespun humor, democratic values, and philosophical pragmatism. </p><p> But the most interesting thing that Franklin invented, and continually reinvented, was himself. America's first great publicist, he was, in his life and in his writings, consciously trying to create a new American archetype. In the process, he carefully crafted his own persona, portrayed it in public, and polished it for posterity. </p><p> Through it all, he trusted the hearts and minds of his fellow \"leather-aprons\" more than he did those of any inbred elite. He saw middle-class values as a source of social strength, not as something to be derided. His guiding principle was a \"dislike of everything that tended to debase the spirit of the common people.\" Few of his fellow founders felt this comfort with democracy so fully, and none so intuitively. </p><p> In this colorful and intimate narrative, Isaacson provides the full sweep of Franklin's amazing life, from his days as a runaway printer to his triumphs as a statesman, scientist, and Founding Father. He chronicles Franklin's tumultuous relationship with his illegitimate son and grandson, his practical marriage, and his flirtations with the ladies of Paris. He also shows how Franklin helped to create the American character and why he has a particular resonance in the twenty-first century.</p>",

        "description": "Each time history repeats itself, the cost goes up. The twentieth century\u2014a time of unprecedented progress\u2014has produced a tremendous strain on the very elements that comprise life itself: This raises the key question of the twenty-first century: How much longer can this go on? With wit and erudition, Ronald Wright lays out a-convincing case that history has always provided an answer, whether we care to notice or not. From Neanderthal man to the Sumerians to the Roman Empire, A Short History of Progress dissects the cyclical nature of humanity's development and demise, the 10,000-year old experiment that we've unleashed but have yet to control. It is Wright's contention that only by understanding and ultimately breaking from the patterns of progress and disaster that humanity has repeated around the world since the Stone Age can we avoid the onset of a new Dark Age. Wright illustrates how various cultures throughout history have literally manufactured their own end by producing an overabundance of innovation and stripping bare the very elements that allowed them to initially advance. Wright's book is brilliant; a fascinating rumination on the hubris at the heart of human development and the pitfalls we still may have time to avoid.",

        "description": "<strong>\"One of America's great chefs\" (<em>Vogue</em>) shares how his drive to cook immaculate food won him international renown-and fueled his miraculous triumph over tongue cancer.</strong> <br><br> In 2007, chef Grant Achatz seemingly had it made. He had been named one of the best new chefs in America by <em>Food &amp; Wine</em> in 2002, received the James Beard Foundation Rising Star Chef of the Year Award in 2003, and in 2005 he and Nick Kokonas opened the conceptually radical restaurant Alinea, which was named Best Restaurant in America by <em>Gourmet</em> magazine. Then, positioned firmly in the world's culinary spotlight, Achatz was diagnosed with stage IV squamous cell carcinoma-tongue cancer. <br><br> The prognosis was grim, and doctors agreed the only course of action was to remove the cancerous tissue, which included his entire tongue. Desperate to preserve his quality of life, Grant undertook an alternative treatment of aggressive chemotherapy and radiation. But the choice came at a cost. Skin peeled from the inside of Grant's mouth and throat, he rapidly lost weight, and most alarmingly, he lost his sense of taste. Tapping into the discipline, passion, and focus of being a chef, Grant rarely missed a day of work. He trained his chefs to mimic his palate and learned how to cook with his other senses. As Kokonas was able to attest: The food was never better. Five months later, Grant was declared cancer-free, and just a few months following, he received the James Beard Foundation Outstanding Chef in America Award.  <br><br><em>Life, on the Line</em> tells the story of a culinary trailblazer's love affair with cooking, but it is also a book about survival, about nurturing creativity, and about profound friendship. Already much- anticipated by followers of progressive cuisine, Grant and Nick's gripping narrative is filled with stories from the world's most renowned kitchens-The French Laundry, Charlie Trotter's, el Bulli- and sure to expand the audience that made <em>Alinea</em> the number-one selling restaurant cookbook in America last year.",

Now  Greene has once again mined history and literature to distill the essence of  seduction, the most highly refined mode of influence, the ultimate power  trip.<br><br><em>The Art of Seduction</em> is a masterful synthesis of the work of thinkers  such as Freud, Ovid, Kierkegaard, and Einstein, as well as the achievements of  the greatest seducers throughout history. From Cleopatra to John F. Kennedy,  from Andy Warhol to Josephine Bonaparte, <em>The Art of Seduction</em> gets to the  heart of the character of the seducer and his or her tactics, triumphs and  failures. The seducer's many faces include: the Siren, the Rake, the Ideal  Lover, the Dandy, the Natural, the Coquette, the Charmer, and the Charismatic.  Twenty-four maneuvers will guide readers through the seduction process,  providing cunning, amoral instructions for and analysis of this fascinating,  all-pervasive form of power. Just as beautifully packaged and every bit as  essential as <em>The 48 Laws of Power</em>, <em>The Art of Seduction</em> is an  indispensable primer of persuasion and offers the best lessons on how to take  what you want from whomever you want or how to prevent yourself from being  taken.",

Soon he finds himself looking for his wife as well in a netherworld that lies beneath the placid surface of Tokyo.

        "description": "A free, world-class education for anyone, anywhere: this is the goal of the Khan Academy, a passion project that grew from an ex-engineer and hedge funder's online tutoring sessions with his niece, who was struggling with algebra, into a worldwide phenomenon. Today millions of students, parents, and teachers use the Khan Academy's free videos and software, which have expanded to encompass nearly every conceivable subject; and Academy techniques are being employed with exciting results in a growing number of classrooms around the globe.<br><br>Like many innovators, Khan rethinks existing assumptions and imagines what education could be if freed from them. And his core idea-liberating teachers from lecturing and state-mandated calendars and opening up class time for truly human interaction-has become his life's passion. Schools seek his advice about connecting to students in a digital age, and people of all ages and backgrounds flock to the site to utilize this fresh approach to learning.<br><br>In THE ONE WORLD SCHOOLHOUSE, Khan presents his radical vision for the future of education, as well as his own remarkable story, for the first time. In these pages, you will discover, among other things:<br><br>* How both students and teachers are being bound by a broken top-down model invented in Prussia two centuries ago<br>* Why technology will make classrooms more human and teachers more important<br>* How and why we can afford to pay educators the same as other professionals<br>* How we can bring creativity and true human interactivity back to learning<br>* Why we should be very optimistic about the future of learning.<br><br>Parents and politicians routinely bemoan the state of our education system. Statistics suggest we've fallen behind the rest of the world in literacy, math, and sciences. With a shrewd reading of history, Khan explains how this crisis presented itself, and why a return to \"mastery learning,\" abandoned in the twentieth century and ingeniously revived by tools like the Khan Academy, could offer the best opportunity to level the playing field, and to give all of our children a world-class education now.<br><br>More than just a solution, THE ONE WORLD SCHOOLHOUSE serves as a call for free, universal, global education, and an explanation of how Khan's simple yet revolutionary thinking can help achieve this inspiring goal.",

She has quit smoking, run a marathon, and been promoted at work. The patterns inside her brain, neurologists discover, have fundamentally changed.<br>\u00a0<br>Marketers at Procter &amp; Gamble study videos of people making their beds. They are desperately trying to figure out how to sell a new product called Febreze, on track to be one of the biggest flops in company history. Suddenly, one of them detects a nearly imperceptible pattern\u2014and with a slight shift in advertising, Febreze goes on to earn a billion dollars a year.<br>\u00a0<br>An untested CEO takes over one of the largest companies in America. His first order of business is attacking a single pattern among his employees\u2014how they approach worker safety\u2014and soon the firm, Alcoa, becomes the top performer in the Dow Jones.<br>\u00a0<br>What do all these people have in common? They achieved success by focusing on the patterns that shape every aspect of our lives. <br>\u00a0<br>They succeeded by transforming habits.<br>\u00a0<br>In <em>The Power of Habit, </em>award-winning <em>New York Times</em> business reporter Charles Duhigg takes us to the thrilling edge of scientific discoveries that explain why habits exist and how they can be changed. With penetrating intelligence and an ability to distill vast amounts of information into engrossing narratives, Duhigg brings to life a whole new understanding of human nature and its potential for transformation. <br>\u00a0<br>Along the way we learn why some people and companies struggle to change, despite years of trying, while others seem to remake themselves overnight. We visit laboratories where neuroscientists explore how habits work and where, exactly, they reside in our brains. We discover how the right habits were crucial to the success of Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, and civil-rights hero Martin Luther King, Jr. We go inside Procter &amp; Gamble, Target superstores, Rick Warren\u2019s Saddleback Church, NFL locker rooms, and the nation\u2019s largest hospitals and see how implementing so-called keystone habits can earn billions and mean the difference between failure and success, life and death.<br>\u00a0<br>At its core, <em>The Power of Habit</em> contains an exhilarating argument: The key to exercising regularly, losing weight, raising exceptional children, becoming more productive, building revolutionary companies and social movements, and achieving success is understanding how habits work. <br>\u00a0<br>Habits aren\u2019t destiny. As Charles Duhigg shows, by harnessing this new science, we can transform our businesses, our communities, and our lives.",

        "description": "<strong>Foer's unlikely journey from chronically forgetful science journalist to U.S. Memory Champion frames a revelatory exploration of the vast, hidden impact of memory on every aspect of our lives. </strong> <br><br> On average, people squander forty days annually compensating for things they've forgotten. Joshua Foer used to be one of those people. But after a year of memory training, he found himself in the finals of the U.S. Memory Championship. Even more important, Foer found a vital truth we too often forget: In every way that matters, we are the sum of our memories. <br><br><em>Moonwalking with Einstein</em> draws on cutting-edge research, a surprising cultural history of memory, and venerable tricks of the mentalist's trade to transform our understanding of human remembering. Under the tutelage of top \"mental athletes,\" he learns ancient techniques once employed by Cicero to memorize his speeches and by Medieval scholars to memorize entire books. Using methods that have been largely forgotten, Foer discovers that we can all dramatically improve our memories. <br><br> Immersing himself obsessively in a quirky subculture of competitive memorizers, Foer learns to apply techniques that call on imagination as much as determination--showing that memorization can be anything but rote. From the PAO system, which converts numbers into lurid images, to the memory palace, in which memories are stored in the rooms of imaginary structures, Foer's experience shows that the World Memory Championships are less a test of memory than of perseverance and creativity. <br><br> Foer takes his inquiry well beyond the arena of mental athletes-across the country and deep into his own mind. In San Diego, he meets an affable old man with one of the most severe case of amnesia on record, where he learns that memory is at once more elusive and more reliable than we might think. In Salt Lake City, he swaps secrets with a savant who claims to have memorized more than nine thousand books. At a high school in the South Bronx, he finds a history teacher using twenty- five-hundred-year-old memory techniques to give his students an edge in the state Regents exam. <br><br> At a time when electronic devices have all but rendered our individual memories obsolete, Foer's bid to resurrect the forgotten art of remembering becomes an urgent quest. <em>Moonwalking with Einstein</em> brings Joshua Foer to the apex of the U.S. Memory Championship and readers to a profound appreciation of a gift we all possess but that too often slips our minds.",

These simple methods represent a new era in sexual intimacy, one in which the exchange of pleasure occurs on a level playing field and fulfillment is mutual.<br><br><em>She Comes First</em> exuberantly offers a fresh new sexual philosophy that inspires every man to make a mantra of Rhett Butler's infamous line to Scarlett O'Hara, \"You should be kissed, and often, and by someone who knows how.\"",

The summer of peace and plenty, ten years long, is drawing to a close, and the harsh, chill winter approaches like an angry beast. Two great leaders\u2014Lord Eddard Stark and Robert Baratheon\u2014who held sway over an age of enforced peace are dead...victims of royal treachery. Now, from the ancient citadel of Dragonstone to the forbidding shores of Winterfell, chaos reigns, as pretenders to the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms prepare to stake their claims through tempest, turmoil, and war. <br><br>As a prophecy of doom cuts across the sky\u2014a comet the color of blood and flame\u2014six factions struggle for control of a divided land. Eddard's son Robb has declared himself King in the North. In the south, Joffrey, the heir apparent, rules in name only, victim of the scheming courtiers who teem over King's Landing. Robert's two brothers each seek their own dominion, while a disfavored house turns once more to conquest. And a continent away, an exiled queen, the Mother of Dragons, risks everything to lead her precious brood across a hard hot desert to win back the crown that is rightfully hers. <br><br>A Clash of Kings transports us into a magnificent, forgotten land of revelry and revenge, wizardry and wartime. It is a tale in which maidens cavort with madmen, brother plots against brother, and the dead rise to walk in the night. Here a princess masquerades as an orphan boy; a knight of the mind prepares a poison for a treacherous sorceress; and wild men descend from the Mountains of the Moon to ravage the countryside. <br><br>Against a backdrop of incest and fratricide, alchemy and murder, the price of glory may be measured in blood. And the spoils of victory may just go to the  men and women possessed of the coldest steel...and the coldest hearts. For when rulers clash, all of the land feels the tremors. <br><br>Audacious, inventive, brilliantly imagined, A Clash of Kings is a novel of dazzling beauty and boundless enchantment;a tale of pure excitement you will never forget.",

For what he calls the \"antifragile\" is one step beyond robust, as it benefits from adversity, uncertainty and stressors, just as human bones get stronger when subjected to stress and tension.<br><br>Taleb stands uncertainty on its head, making it desirable, and proposing that things be built in an antifragile manner. Extremely ambitious and multidisciplinary, Antifragility provides a blueprint for how to behave-and thrive-in a world we don't understand and which is too uncertain for us to even try to understand. He who is not antifragile will perish. Why is the city state better than the nation state, why is debt bad for you, and why is almost everything modern bound to fail? The book covers innovation, health, biology, medicine, life decisions, politics, foreign policy, urban planning, war, personal finance, and economic systems. Throughout, the voice and recipes of the ancient wisdom from Phoenician, Roman, Greek, and Medieval sources are heard loud and clear.",

        "description": "By the author of the acclaimed bestsellers <em>Benjamin Franklin </em>and <em>Steve Jobs</em>, this is the definitive biography of Albert Einstein.<strong> </strong><br><br>How did his mind work? What made him a genius? Isaacson&amp;#8217;s biography shows how his scientific imagination sprang from the rebellious nature of his personality. His fascinating story is a testament to the connection between creativity and freedom.<br><br> Based on newly released personal letters of Einstein, this book explores how an imaginative, impertinent patent clerk&amp;#8212;a struggling father in a difficult marriage who couldn&amp;#8217;t get a teaching job or a doctorate&amp;#8212;became the mind reader of the creator of the cosmos, the locksmith of the mysteries of the atom, and the universe. His success came from questioning conventional wisdom and marveling at mysteries that struck others as mundane. This led him to embrace a morality and politics based on respect for free minds, free spirits, and free individuals.<br><br> These traits are just as vital for this new century of globalization, in which our success will depend on our creativity, as they were for the beginning of the last century, when Einstein helped usher in the modern age.",

        "description": "<strong><em>Fire, water, air, earth\u2014our most trusted food expert recounts the story of his culinary education</em></strong><br><br> In <em>Cooked</em>, Michael Pollan explores the previously uncharted territory of his own kitchen. Here, he discovers the enduring power of the four classical elements\u2014fire, water, air, and earth\u2014to transform the stuff of nature into delicious things to eat and drink. Apprenticing himself to a succession of culinary masters, Pollan learns how to grill with fire, cook with liquid, bake bread, and ferment everything from cheese to beer. In the course of his journey, he discovers that the cook occupies a special place in the world, standing squarely between nature and culture. Both realms are transformed by cooking, and so, in the process, is the cook.<br><br> Each section of <em>Cooked</em> tracks Pollan\u2019s effort to master a single classic recipe using one of the four elements. A North Carolina barbecue pit master tutors him in the primal magic of fire; a Chez Panisse\u2013trained cook schools him in the art of braising; a celebrated baker teaches him how air transforms grain and water into a fragrant loaf of bread; and finally, several mad-genius \u201cfermentos\u201d (a tribe that includes brewers, cheese makers, and all kinds of picklers) reveal how fungi and bacteria can perform the most amazing alchemies of all. The reader learns alongside Pollan, but the lessons move beyond the practical to become an investigation of how cooking involves us in a web of social and ecological relationships: with plants and animals, the soil, farmers, our history and culture, and, of course, the people our cooking nourishes and delights. Cooking, above all, connects us.<br><br> The effects of not cooking are similarly far reaching. Relying upon corporations to process our food means we consume huge quantities of fat, sugar, and salt; disrupt an essential link to the natural world; and weaken our relationships with family and friends. In fact, <em>Cooked</em> argues, taking back control of cooking may be the single most important step anyone can take to help make the American food system healthier and more sustainable. Reclaiming cooking as an act of enjoyment and self-reliance, learning to perform the magic of these everyday transformations, opens the door to a more nourishing life.<br><br><br>",

In the east, Daenerys Targaryen, the last scion of House Targaryen, rules with her three dragons as queen of a city built on dust and death. But Daenerys has thousands of enemies, and many have set out to find her. As they gather, one young man embarks upon his own quest for the queen, with an entirely different goal in mind.<br><br>Fleeing from Westeros with a price on his head, Tyrion Lannister, too, is making his way to Daenerys. But his newest allies in this quest are not the rag-tag band they seem, and at their heart lies one who could undo Daenerys's claim to Westeros forever.<br><br>Meanwhile, to the north lies the mammoth Wall of ice and stone \u2014 a structure only as strong as those guarding it. There, Jon Snow, 998th Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, will face his greatest challenge. For he has powerful foes not only within the Watch but also beyond, in the land of the creatures of ice.<br><br>From all corners, bitter conflicts reignite, intimate betrayals are perpetrated, and a grand cast of outlaws and priests, soldiers and skinchangers, nobles and slaves, will face seemingly insurmountable obstacles. Some will fail, others will grow in the strength of darkness. But in a time of rising restlessness, the tides of destiny and politics will lead inevitably to the greatest dance of all.<br><br>",

        "description": "In this eye-opening account, Cal Newport debunks the long-held belief that \"follow your passion\" is good advice. <br> Not only is the clich\u00e9 flawed-preexisting passions are rare and have little to do with how most people end up loving their work-but it can also be dangerous, leading to anxiety and chronic job hopping.<br> After making his case against passion, Newport sets out on a quest to discover the reality of how people end up loving what they do. Spending time with organic farmers, venture capitalists, screenwriters, freelance computer programmers, and others who admitted to deriving great satisfaction from their work, Newport uncovers the strategies they used and the pitfalls they avoided in developing their compelling careers. <br> Matching your job to a preexisting passion does not matter, he reveals. Passion comes after you put in the hard work to become excellent at something valuable, not before. <br> In other words, what you do for a living is much less important than how you do it.<br> With a title taken from the comedian Steve Martin, who once said his advice for aspiring entertainers was to \"be so good they can't ignore you,\" Cal Newport's clearly written manifesto is mandatory reading for anyone fretting about what to do with their life, or frustrated by their current job situation and eager to find a fresh new way to take control of their livelihood. He provides an evidence-based blueprint for creating work you love.<br> SO GOOD THEY CAN'T IGNORE YOU will change the way we think about our careers, happiness, and the crafting of a remarkable life.<br><br>",

        "description": "Lean In--Sheryl Sandberg's provocative, inspiring book about women and power--grew out of an electrifying TED talk Sandberg gave in 2010, in which she expressed her concern that progress for women in achieving major leadership positions had stalled. The talk became a phenomenon and has since been viewed nearly two million times. In Lean In, she fuses humorous personal anecdotes, singular lessons on confidence and leadership, and practical advice for women based on research, data, her own experiences, and the experiences of other women of all ages. Sandberg has an uncanny gift for cutting through layers of ambiguity that surround working women, and in Lean In she grapples, piercingly, with the great questions of modern life. Her message to women is overwhelmingly positive. She is a trailblazing model for the ideas she so passionately espouses, and she's on the pulse of a topic that has never been more relevant.",

With humor and insight, she chronicles her adventures during the twelve months she spent test-driving the wisdom of the ages, current scientific research, and lessons from popular culture about how to be happier.<br><br>Rubin didn't have the option to uproot herself, nor did she really want to; instead she focused on improving her life as it was. Each month she tackled a new set of resolutions: give proofs of love, ask for help, find more fun, keep a gratitude notebook, forget about results. She immersed herself in principles set forth by all manner of experts, from Epicurus to Thoreau to Oprah to Martin Seligman to the Dalai Lama to see what worked for her\u2014and what didn't.<br><br>Her conclusions are sometimes surprising\u2014she finds that money can buy happiness, when spent wisely; that novelty and challenge are powerful sources of happiness; that \"treating\" yourself can make you feel worse; that venting bad feelings doesn't relieve them; that the very smallest of changes can make the biggest difference\u2014and they range from the practical to the profound.<br><br>Written with charm and wit, <em>The Happiness Project</em> is illuminating yet entertaining, thought-provoking yet compulsively readable. Gretchen Rubin's passion for her subject jumps off the page, and reading just a few chapters of this book will inspire you to start your own happiness project.",

Committed to sharing what the scientific community already knew about self-control, McGonigal created a course called \"The Science of Willpower\" for Stanford University's Continuing Studies Program. The course was an instant hit and spawned the hugely successful <em>Psychology Today</em> blog with the same name.<br><br>Informed by the latest research and combining cutting-edge insights from psychology, economics, neuroscience, and medicine, McGonigal's book explains exactly what willpower is, how it works, and why it matters. Readers will learn:<br><br><br>Willpower is a mind-body response, not a virtue. It is a biological function that can be improved through mindfulness, exercise, nutrition, and sleep. People who have better control of their attention, emotions, and actions are healthier, happier, have more satisfying relationships, and make more money. Willpower is not an unlimited resource. Too much self-control can actually be bad for your health. Temptation and stress hijack the brain's systems of self-control, and that the brain can be trained for greater willpower.<br><br>In the groundbreaking tradition of <em>Getting Things Done, The Willpower Instinct</em> combines life-changing prescriptive advice and complementary exercises to help readers with goals ranging from a healthier life to more patient parenting, from greater productivity at work to finally finishing the basement.",

Dieting is a popular hobby in the twenty-first century, and the result is typically a slow but steady weight gain over the years. Oops.

To remedy this, he formed the idea of journeying about his house from room to room to \u201cwrite a history of the world without leaving home.\u201d The bathroom provides the occasion for a history of hygiene; the bedroom, sex, death, and sleep; the kitchen, nutrition and the spice trade; and so on, as Bryson shows how each has figured in the evolution of private life.

To that end, he has attached himself to a host of the world\u2019s most advanced (and often obsessed) archaeologists, anthropologists, and mathematicians, travelling to their offices, laboratories, and field camps. He has read (or tried to read) their books, pestered them with questions, apprenticed himself to their powerful minds. <strong>A Short History of Nearly Everything</strong><em> </em>is the record of this quest, and it is a sometimes profound, sometimes funny, and always supremely clear and entertaining adventure in the realms of human knowledge, as only Bill Bryson can render it.

Gin was born from a conifer shrub when a Dutch physician added oil of juniper to a clear spirit, believing that juniper berries would cure kidney disorders. \"The Drunken Botanist\" uncovers the enlightening botanical history and the fascinating science and chemistry of over 150 plants, flowers, trees, and fruits (and even one fungus).<br><br>Some of the most extraordinary and obscure plants have been fermented and distilled, and they each represent a unique cultural contribution to our global drinking traditions and our history. Molasses was an essential ingredient in American independence: when the British forced the colonies to buy British (not French) molasses for their New World rum-making, the settlers outrage kindled the American Revolution. Rye, which turns up in countless spirits, is vulnerable to ergot, which contains a precursor to LSD, and some historians have speculated that the Salem witch trials occurred because girls poisoned by ergot had seizures that made townspeople think they d been bewitched. Then there's the tale of the thirty-year court battle that took place over the trademarking of Angostura bitters, which may or may not actually contain bark from the Angostura tree.<br><br>With a delightful two-color vintage-style interior, over fifty drink recipes, growing tips for gardeners, and advice that carries Stewart's trademark wit, this is the perfect gift for gardeners and cocktail aficionados alike.",

The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; . . . who at best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly.\u201d \u2014Theodore Roosevelt<br><br>Every day we experience the uncertainty, risks, and emotional exposure that define what it means to be vulnerable, or to dare greatly. Whether the arena is a new relationship, an important meeting, our creative process, or a difficult family conversation, we must find the courage to walk into vulnerability and engage with our whole hearts.<br><br>In <em>Daring Greatly</em>, Dr. Brown challenges everything we think we know about vulnerability. Based on twelve years of research, she argues that vulnerability is not weakness, but rather our clearest path to courage, engagement, and meaningful connection. The book that Dr. Brown\u2019s many fans have been waiting for, <em>Daring Greatly</em> will spark a new spirit of truth\u2014and trust\u2014in our organizations, families, schools, and communities.",

        "book_title": "Salt Sugar Fat: How the Food Giants Hooked Us",
        "description": "Every year, the average American eats 33 pounds of cheese (triple what we ate in 1970) and 70 pounds of sugar (about 22 teaspoons a day). We ingest 8,500 milligrams of salt a day, double the recommended amount, and almost none of that comes from the shakers on our table. It comes from processed food. It\u2019s no wonder, then, that one in three adults, and one in five kids, is clinically obese. It\u2019s no wonder that 26 million Americans have diabetes, the processed food industry in the U.S. accounts for $1 trillion a year in sales, and the total economic cost of this health crisis is approaching $300 billion a year.<br><br>In Salt Sugar Fat, Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative reporter Michael Moss shows how we got here. Featuring examples from some of the most recognizable (and profitable) companies and brands of the last half century - including Kraft, Coca-Cola, Lunchables, Kellogg, Nestl\u00e9, Oreos, Cargill, Capri Sun, and many more - Moss\u2019s explosive, empowering narrative is grounded in meticulous, often eye-opening research.<br><br>Moss takes us inside the labs where food scientists use cutting-edge technology to calculate the \"bliss point\" of sugary beverages or enhance the \"mouthfeel\" of fat by manipulating its chemical structure. He unearths marketing campaigns designed - in a technique adapted from tobacco companies - to redirect concerns about the health risks of their products: Dial back on one ingredient, pump up the other two, and tout the new line as \"fat-free\" or \"low-salt\". He talks to concerned executives who confess that they could never produce truly healthy alternatives to their products even if serious regulation became a reality. Simply put: The industry itself would cease to exist without salt, sugar, and fat. Just as millions of \"heavy users\" - as the companies refer to their most ardent customers - are addicted to this seductive trio, so too are the companies that peddle them. You will never look at a nutrition label the same way again.",

How did radium (Ra, 88) nearly ruin Marie Curie's reputation? And why is gallium (Ga, 31) the go-to element for laboratory pranksters?*<br><br>The Periodic Table is a crowning scientific achievement, but it's also a treasure trove of adventure, betrayal, and obsession. These fascinating tales follow every element on the table as they play out their parts in human history, and in the lives of the (frequently) mad scientists who discovered them. THE DISAPPEARING SPOON masterfully fuses science with the classic lore of invention, investigation, and discovery--from the Big Bang through the end of time. *Though solid at room temperature, gallium is a moldable metal that melts at 84 degrees Fahrenheit. A classic science prank is to mold gallium spoons, serve them with tea, and watch guests recoil as their utensils disappear.",

A mix of popular psychology and trivia, McRaney\u2019s insights have struck a chord with thousands, and his blog\u2014and now podcasts and videos\u2014have become an Internet phenomenon. <br><br> Like <em>You Are Not So Smart</em>, <em> You Are Now Less Dumb</em> is grounded in the idea that we all believe ourselves to be objective observers of reality\u2014except we\u2019re not. But that\u2019s okay, because our delusions keep us sane. Expanding on this premise, McRaney provides eye-opening analyses of fifteen more ways we fool ourselves every day, including:<br>The Misattribution of Arousal (Environmental factors have a greater affect on our emotional arousal than the person right in front of us) Sunk Cost Fallacy (We will engage in something we don\u2019t enjoy just to make the time or money already invested \u201cworth it\u201d) Deindividuation (Despite our best intentions, we practically disappear when subsumed by a mob mentality) McRaney also reveals the true price of happiness, why Benjamin Franklin was such a badass, and how to avoid falling for our own lies.

How can good companies, mediocre companies, even bad companies achieve enduring greatness?<br><br>The Study<br>For years, this question preyed on the mind of Jim Collins.

Indeed, no artistic movement has ever been quite so controversial. The drama of its birth, played out on canvas and against the backdrop of the Franco-Prussian War and the Commune, would at times resemble a battlefield; and as Ross King reveals, it would reorder both history and culture, and resonate around the world.",

Together with three veterans of the St. Vincent\u2019s Home for Boys, he works for small-time mobster Frank Minna\u2019s limo service cum detective agency. Life without Frank Minna, the charismatic King of Brooklyn, would be unimaginable, so who cares if the tasks he sets them are, well, not exactly legal. But when Frank is fatally stabbed, one of Lionel\u2019s colleagues lands in jail, the other two vie for his position, and the victim\u2019s widow skips town. Lionel\u2019s world is suddenly topsy-turvy, and this outcast who has trouble even conversing attempts to untangle the threads of the case while trying to keep the words straight in his head. <em>Motherless Brooklyn</em> is a brilliantly original homage to the classic detective novel by one of the most acclaimed writers of his generation.",

        "description": "<strong>Most startups fail. But many of those failures are preventable.\u00a0 The Lean Startup is a new approach being adopted across the globe, changing the way companies are built and new products are launched. <br></strong><br>Eric Ries defines a startup as\u00a0<strong>an organization dedicated to creating something new under conditions of extreme uncertainty</strong>. This is just as true for one person in a garage or a group of seasoned professionals in a Fortune 500 boardroom. What they have in common is a mission to penetrate that fog of uncertainty to discover a successful path to a sustainable business. <br><br>The Lean Startup approach fosters companies that are both more capital efficient and that leverage human creativity more effectively.\u00a0 Inspired by lessons from lean manufacturing, it relies on \u201cvalidated learning,\u201d rapid scientific experimentation, as well as a number of counter-intuitive practices that shorten product development cycles, measure actual progress without resorting to vanity metrics, and learn what customers really want. It enables a company to shift directions with agility, altering plans inch by inch, minute by minute. <br><br>Rather than wasting time creating elaborate business plans, <em>The Lean Startup</em> offers entrepreneurs - in companies of all sizes - a way to test their vision continuously, to adapt and adjust before it\u2019s too late. Ries provides a scientific approach to creating and managing successful startups in a age when companies need to innovate more than ever.",

        "description": "One of the great fears many of us face is that despite all our effort and striving, we will discover at the end that we have wasted our life. In <em>A Guide to the Good Life</em>, William B. Irvine plumbs the wisdom of Stoic philosophy, one of the most popular and successful schools of thought in ancient Rome, and shows how its insight and advice are still remarkably applicable to modern lives.<br>       In <em>A Guide to the Good Life</em>, Irvine offers a refreshing presentation of Stoicism, showing how this ancient philosophy can still direct us toward a better life. Using the psychological insights and the practical techniques of the Stoics, Irvine offers a roadmap for anyone seeking to avoid the feelings of chronic dissatisfaction that plague so many of us. Irvine looks at various Stoic techniques for attaining tranquility and shows how to put these techniques to work in our own life. As he does so, he describes his own experiences practicing Stoicism and offers valuable first-hand advice for anyone wishing to live better by following in the footsteps of these ancient philosophers. Readers learn how to minimize worry, how to let go of the past and focus our efforts on the things we can control, and how to deal with insults, grief, old age, and the distracting temptations of fame and fortune. We learn from Marcus Aurelius the importance of prizing only things of true value, and from Epictetus we learn how to be more content with what we have.<br>        Finally, <em>A Guide to the Good Life</em> shows readers how to become thoughtful observers of their own life.  If we watch ourselves as we go about our daily business and later reflect on what we saw, we can better identify the sources of distress and eventually avoid that pain in our life. By doing this, the Stoics thought, we can hope to attain a truly joyful life.",

        "description": "In his New York Times bestseller Steal Like an Artist, Austin Kleon showed readers how to unlock their creativity by stealing from the community of other movers and shakers. Now, in an even more forward-thinking and necessary book, he shows how to take that critical next step on a creative journey getting known. Show Your Work! is about why generosity trumps genius. It s about getting findable, about using the network instead of wasting time networking. It s not self-promotion, it s self-discovery let others into your process, then let them steal from you. Filled with illustrations, quotes, stories, and examples, Show Your Work! offers ten transformative rules for being open, generous, brave, productive. In chapters such as You Don t Have to Be a Genius; Share Something Small Every Day; and Stick Around, Kleon creates a user s manual for embracing the communal nature of creativity what he calls the ecology of talent. From broader life lessons about work (you can t find your voice if you don t use it) to the etiquette of sharing and the dangers of oversharing to the practicalities of Internet life (build a good domain name; give credit when credit is due), it s an inspiring manifesto for succeeding as any kind of artist or entrepreneur in the digital age.\"",

Ray neglected his work, spending hours poring over ancient French winemaking texts, learning the techniques and the language, and daydreaming about vineyards. After Ray experienced his first taste of wine from Burgundy, he could wait no longer. He quit his job and went to France to start a winery\u2014with little money, a limited command of French, and virtually no winemaking experience. <br><br>Fueled by determination and <em>joie de vivre</em>, he immersed himself in the extraordinary history of Burgundy\u2019s vineyards and began honing his skills. Ray became a pioneer in his use of ancient techniques in modern times and founded Maison Ilan. In 2009, Ray became the first non-French winemaker to purchase grapes and produce a wine from Le Chambertin, long considered to be one of the most revered and singular vineyards in the world. <br><br>Along with his struggle to capture his wine\u2019s distinct terroir, Ray shares enthralling stories of late-night tastings, flying down the Route National on a vintage Peugeot bicycle with no brakes, and his journey to secure both the trust of his insular Burgundian neighbors and the region\u2019s most coveted grapes. Capturing the sunlight, the smell of the damp soil, and the taste of superlative wine, <em>The Road to Burgundy</em> is a glorious celebration of finding one\u2019s true path in life, and taking a chance\u2014whatever the odds.",

Read \"Economix.\"<br><br>With clear, witty writing and quirky, accessible art, this important and timely graphic novel transforms \"the dismal science\" of economics into a fun, fact-filled story about human nature and our attempts to make the most of what we've got . . . and sometimes what our neighbors have got. \"Economix \"explains it all, from the beginning of Western economic thought, to markets free and otherwise, to economic failures, successes, limitations, and future possibilities. It's the essential, accessible guide to understanding the economy and economic practices. A must-read for every citizen and every voter.PRAISE FOR \"ECONOMIX<br>\"<br>\"It's simply phenomenal. You could read ten books on the subject and not glean as much information.\"-- David Bach founder of FinishRich Media; author of nine \"New York Times\" bestsellers, including \"Debt Free for Life\" and \"The Automatic Millionaire\" \"Goodwin has done the seemingly impossible--he has made economics comprehensible \"and\" funny.\"-- Joel Bakan, author of \"The Corporation\" \"The Pathological Pursuit of Profit and Power\" \"An amazing lesson in true-world economics Delightfully presented, powerful, insightful, and important information What a fun way to fathom a deep and often dark subject \"-- John Perkins, author of \"Hoodwinked\" and the \"New York Times\" bestseller \"Confessions of an Economic Hit Man\" \"Smart, insightful, clear, and as close to the truth as economics can get. The bonus: Who would have guessed that economics could be fun, and--here's the joy--really accessible? Goodwin roots us in history and fills us with common sense understanding. As he puts it early on, economics seems horribly complicated mostly because we're looking at it all at once. Broken down into its component pieces, it's relatively easy to understand. And a good understanding of economics is critical to maneuvering in the world today. If I were compiling a list of the 100 most important books you can read in a lifetime, this would be on it.\"--Stephen Petranek, editor-in-chief, Weider History magazines, former editor-in-chief of \"Discover\" magazine \"Through a potent mix of comics and punchy, concise, accessible prose, Goodwin takes us on a provocative, exhaustively researched, and exceedingly engaging trip through our history and present day, creating an alternately hilarious and scary picture of where we are today as an economy-- and what it all means. More than that, Goodwin makes the arcane, understandable. If your mind either spins or slumbers at the thought of economics, read Goodwin's \"Economix\" and all will become clear. --Nomi Prins, author of \"It Takes a Pillage: An Epic Tale of Power, Deceit, and Untold Trillions\" \"\"Economix\" is a lively, cheerfully opinionated romp through the historical and intellectual foundations of our current economy and our current economic problems. Goodwin has a knack for distilling complex ideas and events in ways that invite the reader to follow the big picture without losing track of what actually happened. Any reader wondering how our economy got to where it is today will find this a refreshing overview.\"--Timothy W. Guinnane, Philip Golden Bartlett Professor of Economic History, Yale University",

        "description": "The Complete Guide to Writing More Maintainable, Manageable, Pleasing, and Powerful Ruby Applications Ruby's widely admired ease of use has a downside: Too many Ruby and Rails applications have been created without concern for their long-term maintenance or evolution. The Web is awash in Ruby code that is now virtually impossible to change or extend. This text helps you solve that problem by using powerful real-world object-oriented design techniques, which it thoroughly explains using simple and practical Ruby examples. Sandi Metz has distilled a lifetime of conversations and presentations about object-oriented design into a set of Ruby-focused practices for crafting manageable, extensible, and pleasing code. She shows you how to build new applications that can survive success and repair existing applications that have become impossible to change. Each technique is illustrated with extended examples, all downloadable from the companion Web site, poodr.info. The first title to focus squarely on object-oriented Ruby application design, \"Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby\" will guide you to superior outcomes, whatever your previous Ruby experience. Novice Ruby programmers will find specific rules to live by; intermediate Ruby programmers will find valuable principles they can flexibly interpret and apply; and advanced Ruby programmers will find a common language they can use to lead development and guide their colleagues. This guide will help youUnderstand how object-oriented programming can help you craft Ruby code that is easier to maintain and upgradeDecide what belongs in a single Ruby classAvoid entangling objects that should be kept separateDefine flexible interfaces among objectsReduce programming overhead costs with duck typingSuccessfully apply inheritanceBuild objects via compositionDesign cost-effective testsSolve common problems associated with poorly designed Ruby code",

Abandoned by his father, Theo is taken in by the family of a wealthy friend. Bewildered by his strange new home on Park Avenue, disturbed by schoolmates who don't know how to talk to him, and tormented above all by his unbearable longing for his mother, he clings to one thing that reminds him of her: a small, mysteriously captivating painting that ultimately draws Theo into the underworld of art.<br><br>As an adult, Theo moves silkily between the drawing rooms of the rich and the dusty labyrinth of an antiques store where he works. He is alienated and in love-and at the center of a narrowing, ever more dangerous circle.<br><br><em>The Goldfinch</em> is a novel of shocking narrative energy and power. It combines unforgettably vivid characters, mesmerizing language, and breathtaking suspense, while plumbing with a philosopher's calm the deepest mysteries of love, identity, and art. It is a beautiful, stay-up-all-night and tell-all-your-friends triumph, an old-fashioned story of loss and obsession, survival and self-invention, and the ruthless machinations of fate.",

Tracking his own strange and unexpected voyage from journeyman cook to globe-traveling professional eater and drinker, and even to fatherhood, Bourdain takes no prisoners as he dissects what he's seen, pausing along the way for a series of confessions, rants, investigations, and interrogations of some of the most controversial figures in food.<br><br>Beginning with a secret and highly illegal after-hours gathering of powerful chefs that he compares to a mafia summit, Bourdain pulls back the curtain\u2014but never pulls his punches\u2014on the modern gastronomical revolution, as only he can. Cutting right to the bone, Bourdain sets his sights on some of the biggest names in the foodie world, including David Chang, the young superstar chef who has radicalized the fine-dining landscape; the revered Alice Waters, whom he treats with unapologetic frankness; the <em>Top Chef</em> winners and losers; and many more.<br><br>And always he returns to the question \"Why cook?\" Or the more difficult \"Why cook well?\" <em>Medium Raw</em> is the deliciously funny and shockingly delectable journey to those answers, sure to delight philistines and gourmands alike.</p>",

Mexican cultures created corn in a specialized breeding process that it has been called man\u2019s first feat of genetic engineering. Indeed, Indians were not living lightly on the land but were landscaping and manipulating their world in ways that we are only now beginning to understand.

        "description": "Over 200 million years ago, geological forces split apart the continents. They developed different suites of flora &amp; fauna. When Columbus came to the Americas, he ended that separation. Driven by the goal of establishing trade with China, he accidentally set off an ecological convulsion as European vessels carried thousands of species to new environs.<br><br>The Columbian Exchange, as researchers call it, is why there are tomatoes in Italy, oranges in Florida, chocolates in Switzerland &amp; chili peppers in Thailand. More important, creatures colonists knew nothing about hitched along. Earthworms, mosquitoes &amp; cockroaches; honeybees, dandelions &amp; African grasses; bacteria, fungi &amp; viruses; rats of every description\u2014all rushed like eager tourists into lands that had never seen their like, changing lives &amp; landscapes.<br><br>Eight decades later, a Spaniard named Legazpi succeeded where Columbus had failed. He sailed west to establish continual trade with China, then the richest, most powerful country. In Manila, a city Legazpi founded, American silver, mined by African &amp; Indian slaves, was sold to Asians in return for silk for Europeans. It was the 1st time that goods &amp; people from every part of the globe were connected in a single worldwide exchange. Much as Columbus created a new world biologically, Legazpi &amp; Spain created a new world economically.<br><br>The Columbian Exchange underlies much of subsequent history. Presenting the latest research by ecologists, anthropologists, archaeologists &amp; historians, Mann shows how the creation of this worldwide network of ecological &amp; economic exchange fostered the rise of Europe, devastated China, convulsed Africa &amp; for two centuries made Mexico City--where Asia, Europe &amp; the new frontier of the Americas interacted--the center of the world. In such encounters, he uncovers the germ of today\u2019s political disputes, from immigration to trade policy to culture wars.",

Christensen says outstanding companies can do everything right and still lose their market leadership -- or worse, disappear completely. And he not only proves what he says, he tells others how to avoid a similar fate.<br><br>Focusing on \"disruptive technology\" -- the Honda Super Cub, Intel's 8088 processor, or the hydraulic excavator, for example -- Christensen shows why most companies miss \"the next great wave.\" Whether in electronics or retailing, a successful company with established products will get pushed aside unless managers know when to abandon traditional business practices. Using the lessons of successes and failures from leading companies, \"The Innovator's Dilemma\" presents a set of rules for capitalizing on the phenomenon of disruptive innovation.<br><br>Find out: When it is right \"not\" to listen to customers. When to invest in developing lower-performance products that promise lower margins. When to pursue small markets at the expense of seemingly larger and more lucrative ones.<br><br>Sharp, cogent, and provocative, \"The Innovator's Dilemma\" is one of the most talked-about books of our time -- and one no savvy manager or entrepreneur should be without.",

        "description": "The ultimate rapid language-learning guide! For those who\u2019ve despaired of ever learning a foreign language, here, finally, is a book that will make the words stick.<strong> </strong>At thirty years old, Gabriel Wyner speaks <em>six </em>languages fluently.\u00a0 He didn\u2019t learn them in school -- who does? -- rather, he learned them in the past few years, working on his own and practicing on the subway, using simple techniques and free online resources. In <em>Fluent Forever</em> Wyner reveals what he\u2019s discovered.\u00a0 <br><strong>\u00a0</strong><br>The greatest challenge to learning a foreign language is the challenge of memory; there are just too many words and too many rules. For every new word we learn, we seem to forget two old ones, and as a result, fluency can seem out of reach.\u00a0<em>Fluent Forever</em>\u00a0tackles this challenge head-on. With empathy for the language-challenged and abundant humor, Wyner deconstructs the learning process, revealing how to build a foreign language in your mind from the ground up.\u00a0<br>\u00a0<br>Starting with pronunciation, you\u2019ll learn how to rewire your ears and turn foreign sounds into\u00a0<em>familiar</em>\u00a0sounds. You'll retrain your tongue to produce those sounds accurately, using\u00a0tricks from opera singers and actors.\u00a0Next, you'll\u00a0begin to tackle words, and connect sounds and spellings to imagery, rather than translations, which will enable you to\u00a0<em>think</em>\u00a0in a foreign language<em>.\u00a0 </em>And with the help of sophisticated spaced-repetition techniques, you'll be able to memorize hundreds of words a month in\u00a0<em>minutes</em>\u00a0every day. Soon, you'll gain the ability to learn grammar and more difficult abstract words--<em>without </em>the tedious drills and exercises of language classes and grammar books. <br>\u00a0<br>This is brain hacking at its most exciting, taking what we know about neuroscience and linguistics and using it to create the most efficient and enjoyable way to learn\u00a0a foreign language in the spare minutes of your day.",

        "description": "Psychiatrist Viktor Frankl's memoir has riveted generations of readers with its descriptions of life in Nazi death camps and its lessons for spiritual survival. Between 1942 and 1945, Frankl labored in four different camps, including Auschwitz, while his parents, brother, and pregnant wife perished. Based on his own experience and the experiences of others he treated later in his practice, Frankl argues that we cannot avoid suffering, but we can choose how to cope with it, find meaning in it, and move forward with renewed purpose. Frankl's theory--known as logotherapy, from the Greek word logos (\"meaning\")--holds that our primary drive in life is not pleasure, as Freud maintained, but the discovery and pursuit of what we personally find meaningful.<br><br>At the time of Frankl's death in 1997, <em>Man's Search for Meaning</em> had sold more than 10 million copies in twenty-four languages. A 1991 reader survey for the Library of Congress that asked readers to name a \"book that made a difference in your life\" found <em>Man's Search for Meaning</em> among the ten most influential books in America.",

After numerous refusals from Minor to visit his home in Oxford, Murray set out to find him.

Habits are the invisible architecture of everyday life.\u00a0It takes work to make a habit, but once that habit is set, we can harness the energy of habits to build happier, stronger, more productive lives.<br> \u00a0<br> So if habits are a key to change, then what we really need to know is: <em>How do we change our habits</em>?<br> \u00a0<br><em>Better than Before</em> answers that question. It presents a practical, concrete framework to allow readers to understand their habits\u2014and to change them for good. Infused with Rubin\u2019s compelling voice, rigorous research, and easy humor, and packed with vivid stories of lives transformed, <em>Better than Before</em> explains the (sometimes counter-intuitive) core principles of habit formation. <br> \u00a0<br> Along the way, Rubin uses herself as guinea pig, tests her theories on family and friends, and answers readers\u2019 most pressing questions\u2014oddly, questions that other writers and researchers tend to ignore:\u00a0<br><br>\u2022\u00a0Why do I find it tough to create a habit for something I\u00a0<em>love</em>\u00a0to do? <br>\u2022\u00a0Sometimes I can change a habit overnight, and sometimes I can\u2019t change a habit, no matter how hard I try. Why? <br>\u2022\u00a0How quickly can I change a habit? <br>\u2022\u00a0What can I do to make sure I stick to a new habit? <br>\u2022\u00a0How can I help someone else change a habit? <br>\u2022\u00a0Why can I keep habits that benefit others, but can\u2019t make habits that are just for me? <br><br> Whether readers want to get more sleep, stop checking their devices, maintain a healthy weight, or finish an important project, habits make\u00a0change possible. Reading just a few chapters of <em>Better Than Before</em> will make readers eager to start work on their own habits\u2014even before they\u2019ve finished the book.",

But in the last twenty years, schools have dramatically increased standardized testing, sacrificing hours of classroom time. What is the cost to students, teachers, and families? How do we preserve space for self-directed learning and development\u2014especially when we still want all children to hit the mark?<br><br><em>The Test</em> explores all sides of this problem\u2014where these tests came from, their limitations and flaws, and ultimately what parents, teachers, and concerned citizens can do. It recounts the shocking history and tempestuous politics of testing and borrows strategies from fields as diverse as games, neuroscience, and ancient philosophy to help children cope. It presents the stories of families, teachers, and schools maneuvering within and beyond the existing educational system, playing and winning the testing game. And it offers a glimpse into a future of better tests. With an expert\u2019s depth, a writer\u2019s flair, and a hacker\u2019s creativity, Anya Kamenetz has written an essential book for any parent who has wondered: what do I do about all these tests?",

We learn about the jinx that was Robert Todd Lincoln (present at the assassinations of Presidents Lincoln, Garfield, and McKinley) and witness the politicking that went into the making of the Lincoln Memorial. The resulting narrative is much more than an entertaining and informative travelogue\u2014it is the disturbing and fascinating story of how American death has been manipulated by popular culture, including literature, architecture, sculpture, and\u2014the author's favorite\u2014 historical tourism. Though the themes of loss and violence are explored and we make detours to see how the Republican Party became the Republican Party, there are all kinds of lighter diversions along the way into the lives of the three presidents and their assassins, including mummies, show tunes, mean-spirited totem poles, and a nineteenth-century biblical sex cult.",

Now Ms. Luna expands her ideas into an inspirational, highly visual gift book for every recent graduate, every artist, every seeker, every career changer.<br><br> The Crossroads of Should and Must has a universal message\u2014we get to choose the path between Should and Must. And it gives every reader permission to embrace this message. It\u2019s about the difference between jobs, careers, and callings. The difference between going to work and becoming one with your work. Why knowing what you want is often the hardest part. It gives eye-opening techniques for reconnecting with one\u2019s inner voice, like writing your own obituary (talk about putting life in perspective). It talks about the most common fears of choosing Must over Should\u2014money, time, <strong>space</strong>, and the ultimate fear: total vulnerability\u2014and shores up our hesitation with inspiring stories of and quotes from the artists and writers and thinkers who\u2019ve faced their own crossroads of Should and Must and taken the leap.

        "description": "<strong>An impassioned, tender, and joyous memoir by the author of <em>Musicophilia</em> and <em>The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat</em>.</strong>\u00a0<br><br>When Oliver Sacks was twelve years old, a perceptive schoolmaster wrote in his report: \"Sacks will go far, if he does not go too far.\" It is now abundantly clear that Sacks has never stopped going. From its opening pages on his youthful obsession with motorcycles and speed, <em>On the Move</em> is infused with his restless energy. As he recounts his experiences as a young neurologist in the early 1960s, first in California, where he struggled with drug addiction and then in New York, where he discovered a long-forgotten illness in the back wards of a chronic hospital, we see how his engagement with patients comes to define his life.<br><br>With unbridled honesty and humor, Sacks shows us that the same energy that drives his physical passions--weight lifting and swimming--also drives his cerebral passions. He writes about his love affairs, both romantic and intellectual; his guilt over leaving his family to come to America; his bond with his schizophrenic brother; and the writers and scientists--Thom Gunn, A. R. Luria, W. H. Auden, Gerald M. Edelman,\u00a0Francis Crick--who influenced him. <em>On the Move</em> is the story of a brilliantly unconventional physician and writer--and of the man who has illuminated the many ways that the brain makes us human.",

Unable to think clearly, or work, or even get out of bed, she became anxious and depressed, even suicidal\u2014a common symptom for concussion sufferers. But rather than let herself sink further, she decided to get better by doing what she does best: she turned her recovery process into a game. What started as a simple motivational exercise became a set of rules she shared on her blog. These rules became a digital game, then an online portal and a major research study with the National Institutes of Health. Today more than 400,000 people have played SuperBetter to get happier and healthier.<br><br>But the ideas behind\u00a0<em>SuperBetter</em>\u00a0are much bigger than just one game. In this book, McGonigal reveals a decade\u2019s worth of scientific research into the ways\u00a0<em>all</em>\u00a0games change how we respond to stress, challenge, and pain. She explains how we can cultivate new powers of recovery and resilience in everyday life simply by adopting a\u00a0<em>gameful</em>\u00a0mind-set. Being gameful means bringing the same psychological strengths we naturally display when we play games\u2014such as optimism, creativity, courage, and determination\u2014to real-world situations.<br><br>McGonigal explores the best ways to harness these gameful skills in the real world not only to experience \u201cposttraumatic growth,\u201d but also to tackle positive life goals, achieving what she calls \u201cpostecstatic growth.\u201d To show how, she shares stories and data from players who have followed the SuperBetter rules to get stronger, happier, and braver in the face of depression, anxiety, illness, and injury, as well as to achieve major goals like losing weight, running a marathon, or finding a new job.<br><br>The SuperBetter method contains seven rules for activating gameful strengths in everyday life, distilled from McGonigal\u2019s own pioneering work and that of others.\u00a0<em>SuperBetter</em>\u00a0the book turns these rules into playful challenges anyone can undertake while reading in a series of quests that explain the science behind the benefits. Playing by the seven rules begins to yield life-changing benefits in a matter of days, and eventually they become an ingrained skill set.<br><br>As inspiring as it is down to earth, grounded in rigorous research, and powered by game design,\u00a0<em>SuperBetter</em>\u00a0is a proven game plan for a better life. You\u2019ll never say that something is \u201cjust a game\u201d again.",

As Ferrazzi discovered early in life, what distinguishes highly successful people from everyone else is the way they use the power of relationships\u2014so that everyone wins.<br><br>In <em>Never Eat Alone</em>, Ferrazzi lays out the specific steps\u2014and inner mindset\u2014he uses to reach out to connect with the thousands of colleagues, friends, and associates on his Rolodex, people he has helped and who have helped him.<br><br>The son of a small-town steelworker and a cleaning lady, Ferrazzi first used his remarkable ability to connect with others to pave the way to a scholarship at Yale, a Harvard MBA, and several top executive posts. Not yet out of his thirties, he developed a network of relationships that stretched from Washington\u2019s corridors of power to Hollywood\u2019s A-list, leading to him being named one of Crain\u2019s 40 Under 40 and selected as a Global Leader for Tomorrow by the Davos World Economic Forum.<br><br>Ferrazzi's form of connecting to the world around him is based on generosity, helping friends connect with other friends. Ferrazzi distinguishes genuine relationship-building from the crude, desperate glad-handling usually associated with \u201cnetworking.\u201d He then distills his system of reaching out to people into practical, proven principles. Among them:<br><br><strong>Don\u2019t keep score:</strong> It\u2019s never simply about getting what you want. It\u2019s about getting what you want and making sure that the people who are important to you get what they want, too.<br><br><strong>\u201cPing\u201d constantly:</strong> The Ins and Outs of reaching out to those in your circle of contacts all the time\u2014not just when you need something.<br><br><strong>Never eat alone:</strong> The dynamics of status are the same whether you\u2019re working at a corporation or attending a society event\u2014 \u201cinvisibility\u201d is a fate worse than failure.<br><br>In the course of the book, Ferrazzi outlines the timeless strategies shared by the world\u2019s most connected individuals, from Katherine Graham to Bill Clinton, Vernon Jordan to the Dalai Lama. <br><br>Chock full of specific advice on handling rejection, getting past gatekeepers, becoming a \u201cconference commando,\u201d and more, <em>Never Eat Alone</em> is destined to take its place alongside <em>How to Win Friends and Influence People</em> as an inspirational classic.",

        "description": "NASA's history is a familiar story, culminating with teh agency successfully landing men on the Moon in 1969. But NASA's prehistory is a rarely told tale, one that is largely absent from the popular space-age literature but that gives the context behind the lunar program. America's space agency wasn't created in a vacuum; it drew together some of the best minds the non-Soviet world had to offer.<br><br>From Wenher von Braun fleeing the ruins of Berlin to the Mercury program, tests of new technologies by pilots such as Neil Armstrong and, in the shadow of Sputnik, the final creation by Dwight D. Eisenhower of NASA, Breaking The Chains of Gravity tells the story of NASA's roots in an engaging and accessible way, against a backdrop of Nazism, communism, and imminent nuclear annihilation.",

        "description": "One of the 20th century's enduring works, <em>One Hundred Years of Solitude</em> is a widely beloved and acclaimed novel known throughout the world, and the ultimate achievement of a Nobel Prize winning career.<br><br>The novel tells the story of the rise and fall of the mythical town of Macondo through the history of the family. It is a rich and brilliant chronicle of life and death, and the tragicomedy of humankind. In the noble, ridiculous, beautiful, and tawdry story of the family, one sees all of humanity, just as in the history, myths, growth, and decay of Macondo, one sees all of Latin America.<br><br>Love and lust, war and revolution, riches and poverty, youth and senility -- the variety of life, the endlessness of death, the search for peace and truth -- these universal themes dominate the novel. Whether he is describing an affair of passion or the voracity of capitalism and the corruption of government, Gabriel Garcia Marquez always writes with the simplicity, ease, and purity that are the mark of a master.<br><br>Alternately reverential and comical, <em>One Hundred Years of Solitude</em> weaves the political, personal, and spiritual to bring a new consciousness to storytelling. Translated into dozens of languages, this stunning work is no less than an accounting of the history of the human race.",

        "description": "Cryptonomicon zooms all over the world, careening conspiratorially back and forth between two time periods--World War II and the present. Our 1940s heroes are the brilliant mathematician Lawrence Waterhouse, crypt analyst extraordinaire, and gung-ho, morphine-addicted marine Bobby Shaftoe. They're part of Detachment 2702, an Allied group trying to break Axis communication codes while simultaneously preventing the enemy from figuring out that their codes have been broken. Their job boils down to layer upon layer of deception. Dr. Alan Turing is also a member of 2702, and he explains the unit's strange workings to Waterhouse. \"When we want to sink a convoy, we send out an observation plane first... Of course, to observe is not its real duty--we already know exactly where the convoy is. Its real duty is to be observed... Then, when we come round and sink them, the Germans will not find it suspicious.\"<br><br>All of this secrecy resonates in the present-day story line, in which the grandchildren of the WWII heroes--inimitable programming geek Randy Waterhouse and the lovely and powerful Amy Shaftoe--team up to help create an offshore data haven in Southeast Asia and maybe uncover some gold once destined for Nazi coffers. To top off the paranoiac tone of the book, the mysterious Enoch Root, key member of Detachment 2702 and the Societas Eruditorum, pops up with an unbreakable encryption scheme left over from WWII to befuddle the 1990s protagonists with conspiratorial ties.",

Every day, craft distilleries are popping up in remote counties and urban centers, offering a wealth of great choices to consumers\u2014and just as many puzzlements. Does the introduction of a simple \u201ce\u201d to go from whisky to whiskey mean anything? What\u2019s the difference between Scotch and Rye? What\u2019s Canadian whisky anyway? And what about the whiskeys of Scotland, Japan, and Ireland? Where's a humble Joe to start?\u00a0\u00a0In this witty kid-style book on an adult topic, Richard Betts boils down his know-how into twenty pages, cooling our \u201cbrown-sweat\u201d anxieties and dividing whiskey into three simple categories: Grain, Wood, and Place. While most whiskey tomes are about as fun as a chemistry lesson, Betts makes the learning slide down easy, reassuring us that this exalted spirit is just distilled beer and, through a nasal romp, helping us figure out which kinds we love best. Humorous illustrations and scratch-and-sniff scents (vanilla, sandalwood, grass, and more) help would-be connoisseurs learn their personal preferences.

        "description": "Colonel Adam Crais's minutemen are literally trapped between a rock and a hard place; in the first days of the Revolutionary War, they find themselves hiding beneath 120 feet of New England stone, with a full regiment of redcoats waiting for them in the daylight... and a door into hell in the cavern below. The black door is open, and it's up to a 16-year-old smith named Ben Locke to find a way to close it. The biggest mysteries of the Locke &amp; Key series are resolved as Clockworks opens, not with a bang, but with the thunderous crash of English cannons.",
